IT SEEMS THERE'S A DEMAND FOR A W/P
SWITCH ON THE ANDROMEDA -- SO HERE IT
IS ...
 
 LOCATED ON THE ANDROMEDA RAM CARD IS
 A PIN NUMBER 25 WHICH HAPPENS TO BE 
 THE POWER (+5V) PIN. IF THIS PIN IS
 FOLLOWED ONTO THE PC BOARD, THERE WILL
 BE TWO RESISTORS (SMALL TUBE-LIKE 
THINGS WITH COLOR BANDS AND ONE LEAD
OUT OF EACH END). AT ONE END THE POWER
WILL GO INTO THIS RESISTOR, AT THE OTHE
R ANOTHER TRACE WILL GO OFF TO SOME
OF THE OTHER ELECTRONICS ON THE BOARD.
WE WANT TO USE THE END THAT HAS THE
TRACES GOING TO OTHER CHIPS ON THE 
BOARD. (CALL THIS POINT #1 (USE EITHER
RESISTOR - THERE ARE TWO)). POINT NUMBE
R TWO IS WHERE PIN 18 FROM THE APPLE
CONNECTOR (7 PINS DOWN FROM 25 ON THE
SAME SIDE) ENTERS ONTO THE PC BOARD
AND IMMEDIATELY GOES THROUGH TO THE
OTHER SIDE (AFTER ABT 1/2 "). THIS
IS POINT #2.  IF YOU TRACE WHERE TH
E THING COMES OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE, 
YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT IT POPS BACK ON
THE SIDE IT STARTED FROM ABOUT 1/2" 
LATER... THIS LITTLE LINK IS WHEERE WE
CUT THE TRACE TO INSERT THE SWITCH.
OK, WE CUT THE TRACE BETWEEN THE TWO
POINTS THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE PC
BOARD. LABEL THE OTHER PLACE WHERE THE
TRACE GOES THROUGH POINT#3.  NOW WE
WILL ATTACH AN SPDT SWITCH TO THE BOARD
 SOLDER ONE WIRE TO POINT 3, AND ATTACH
IT TO THE CENTER TERMINAL OF THE SWITCH
THEN SOLDER A WIRE TO POINT 1 AND 
ATTACH IT TO EITHER SIDE OF THE CENTER
SWITCH. LASTLY, TAKE A WIRE AND SOLDER
IT TO POINT 2 AND THEN TO THE UNUSED
PIN ON THE SWITCH. THERE YOU HAVE IT!
WHEN THE SWITCH HANDLE IS ON THE SAME
SIDE AS THE WIRE FROM POINT #1, REG-
ULAR OPERATION WILL TAKE PLACE. IF THE
SWITCH IS THROWN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
THE CARD WILL BE WRITE PROTECTED.

AN INTERESTING MESSAGE POSTED ON TEXCON
CAUGHT MY EYE..IN LIGHT OF THE NAZI BBS
THE MOLESTERS BBS AND THE BUST IN N.J..
A NEW FEDERAL LAW THAT WOULD OUTLAW OR
SEVERELY RESTRICT BBS ACTIVITY IS BEING
PUSHED THROUGH CONGRESS, ACCORDING TO 
TWO SOURCES THE METAL DETECTOR AND JOHN
EDENS. ANOMG THE RESTRICTIONS DISCUSSED
ARE: *REGISTRATION OF ALL BBS AS PUBLIC
      UTILITIES.
     *SYSOPS REQUIRED TO KEEP LOGS OF 
      ALL USERS "VERIFIED" NAMES AND
      ADDRESSES.
     *SYSOPS REQUIRED TO KEEP LOGS OF
      ALL MESSAGE POSTINGS AND TIMES OF
      POSITNG
     *CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR SYSOPS WHO
      ALLOW ILLEGAL MESSAGE POSTINGS
      WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE KNOW OF
      THE CONTENT OR HAVE HAD A CHANCE
      TO REMOVE IT.
     *BBS USERS WOULD BE "REQUIRED" TO
      USE THEIR LEGAL NAMES.
I HAVE NO WAY TO BE SURE THIS DATA IS 
CORRECT, BUT I SUSPECT IT IS CLOSE TO 
THE TRUTH. CONTACT YOUR CONGRESSIONAL
REPRESENTATIVE, THEY ALMOST ALL HAVE 
800 #'S, AND FIND OUT AND EXPRESS YOUR
OPINION, TOO, WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE

RESPONSIBLE FOR MESSAGES, HE IS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT.  IT'LL

THE WARLOCK LORD
WHEW-

WHAT A YEAR SO FAR-
BOARDS BEING BUSTED THROUGHOUT THE U.S.
NEW COMPUTER CRIME LAWS BEING ABUSED BY
COPS IN MOST STATES (THOUGH MOST OF THESE LAWS CERTAINLY WILL PROVE
UN-CONSTITUTIONAL IF EVER TAKEN TO THE SUPREME COURT).
AND-NEW FEDERAL LAWS IN THE FEDERAL SUB-COMMITTEES WAITIN TO BE VOTED ON!
ALSO,YE SECRET SERVICE HAS TAKEN OVER
FEDERAL COMPUTER INVESTIGATIONS FROM
THE FBI.

SEEMS LIKE EVERY PREDICTION I MADE IN
EARLIER ISSUES HAS COME TRUE!

NOW LET ME TELL YA WHATS HAPPENIN AND
WHY. THE FEDS KNOW EVERYTHING IS GOIN
COMPUTER IN THE NEAR FUTURE,AND NATURALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCYS WANTED THE
WORST LAWS POSSIBLE ON THE BOOKS SO
THEY COULD RUN AMOK WITHOUT ANY CONCERN
OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.
SINCE OUR LEGISLATORS KNOW LITTLE OF
COMPUTER HAPPENINGS,YE SNEAKY FEDS 
DECIDED TO RAID VIRTUALLY EVERY KID
THAT RAN A GOOD BOARD THIS SPRING.
NATURALLY,THEY SPENT MEGA-THOUSANDS
ON THESE RAIDS AND THEN WERE KIND
ENOUGH TO MIS-INFORM THE PRESS AS
TO FABLES LIKE HACKERS MOVIN SATELITES,
ETC.NOW WHEN OUR INK HUNGRY MEDIA GOT
HOLD OF ALL THESE LIES, THEY TRUMP
EM UP EVEN FURTHER IN A BLITZ THAT
INCLUDED FRONT PAGE HEADLINES,UPI,
AND NATIONAL TV.
 O.K. SO HERE SITS MR & MRS CITIZEN
BELIEVIN THAT GARBAGE AN CALLIN MR
CONGRESSMAN SCREAMIN BLOODY MURDER.
 AN YA CAN GUESS WHATS HAPPENIN NOW-
YEP-THEYRE TRYIN TO DEPRIVE US OF
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS (1ST & 4TH
AMMENDMENTS) THROUGH NEW PENDING
LEGISLATION......

NOW YA SAY-WHAT CAN BE DONE?

OK-WRITE EVERY CONGRESSMAN IN YOUR
STATE AND ALSO OTHER STATES AN EVEN
THE PRESIDENT TELLIN THEM YOU DONT
WANT ANY LAWS PASSED THAT WILL
INFRINGE ON YOUR RIGHTS RE COMPUTERS.
MASS PRODUCE THOSE LETTERS & SEND EM
OUT NOW-THESE BAD LAWS CAN ONLY BE
STOPPED BY DOIN SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY.

ALSO-BITCH ABOUT SPENDING ALL OUR
TAX MONEY HARASSING KIDS.THERE IS
A LOT OF CROOKS RUNNIN ROUND THEY
SHOULD BE AFTER WITH THOSE FEDERAL
AGENTS.

AND MAKE UP PETITIONS SIGNED BY 
ANYONE FROM ADULTS TO YOUR CLASSMATES
TO SEND IN ALSO. HECK-SEND THOSE
LETTERS IN EVERY WEEK TILL WE GET
RESULTS.ALSO-POST THIS FILE EVERYWHERE.

        ======================

Suggested reading: Beneath Apple DOS
                   The DOS Manual

Needed equipment: Apple, Drive
                  IQ > 60

  I will start this article by giving
you an overview of what is in DOS and
what it does. First of all there is
the RWTS. This allows you to read or
write a sector at a time. All oper-
ations are done either directly or
indirectly through this. Starting at
$B600 and ending at $BFFF RWTS takes
up about 2.5K. Next is the File
Manager. This goes from $AAC9 to $B5FF
This is a bunch of subroutines which
execute your commands from basic.
Then there are the main DOS routines.
These interpret your commands and tell
the file manager what to do, which in
turn uses the RWTS to do them. These
routines go from $9D00 to $AAC8.
When you have MAXFILES set to 3, DOS
reserves memory from $9600 to $9CFF.
Setting MAXFILES higher will take up
more memory, lower than $9600.
There is another part of DOS, which
resides in the latter part of page 3
or from $3D0 to $3FF. This is called
the Dos Vector Table. I will go into
detail on that later.

 Well now, lets say you put a disk in
the drive and turned your computer on.
Then you loaded a file, edited it and
saved it. Why don't we take a look and
see exactly what is happening.

 When you turn your computer on (if
you have autostart) the code on your
drive controller prom takes over.
This loads in a routine at $800.
This is called Boot 0. Then it jumps
to $801 and executes that code (boot
1). That code loads in sectors 1
through 9 which in turn loads in the
rest of DOS. Then it looks to see if
you have a HELLO program and jumps
to it. The first thing it does when
loading in a program, in this case
the HELLO program, is look at the
catalog track. Then after it finds
the file and the track and sector it
starts on, it reads in the first
sector. The first sector of a program
is called the Track Sector List or
TSL. This is a listing of all tracks
and sectors that have data for that
program. DOS reads this into memory
and then starts loading the program
in. But where does it know where to
load the program in and how does it
know what file type it is?
The file type was back on the catalog,
more (lots more) on that later...
On the first sector of data, not the
TSL, in the first two bytes is the
address to start loading in at. These
bytes as usual are in reverse order.
Well, now you know a little of how
DOS works. Lets go into more detail.

 Here is where I will probably lose
you. If it gets confusing hang on.
 Now we will look at track $11, which
is the catalog track. The VTOC or
Volume Table Of Contents is stored
at track $11, sector $00. This tells
DOS such things as: what sectors are
free, volume #, DOS version, first
link to catalog sector...
Bytes $01 & $02 of the VTOC tells us
 where to find the
first catalog sector. This usually is
track $11, sector $0F. Byte $02 is
the DOS version. Either a "1", "2",
"3", for DOS 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, consec-
utively. Byte $07 is the volume #
usually $FE (254). The next thing of
interest is the Bit Map. Starting at
byte $38 you will see "FFFF0000".
For now, ignore the last two bytes.
The "FFFF" is a binary representation
of what sectors are free on a certain
track. In the two bytes there are
16 bits. Makes sense doesn't it, 16
bits and 16 sectors. If the bit is
set or a "1" then that sector is free.
If it is a "0" then it's used.
Now lets look at the catalog link.
On track $11, sector $0F, byte $01,
are two bytes that tell what track
and sector to find the first catalog
sector. This is almost always track 11
sector $0F. On track $11, sector $0F,
bytes 1 and 2, is a pointer to the
next sector, track $11, sector $0E.
The links continue until sector $01
where you will see zero's in those
bytes. I have been asked many times
how to get more than 105 files onto
a disk. If you edit the second and
third bytes on track $11, sector $01
to "100F", you will be able to use
track $10, sector $0F for a catalog
sector. You can continue on track
10 sector F and make a link to the
next sector and so on. Be sure to
mark it on the bit map or it will
get wiped out when DOS has to write
there. Well, we have covered most
of the VTOC, lets look at how the
catalog sectors are formatted.

 Starting at byte $0B on any catalog
sector, is the entry for a file.
The first two bytes after that, tells
what track and sector the program
starts on. Then is the file type (more
on that later). Next comes the file
name, up to 30 characters. The last
byte before the next entry tells us
how many sectors the file takes.
This usually never goes over 255
sectors, however text files can take
more than 255 sectors. Now we can
look at the file type. We have to look
at this at the binary level. If the
first bit is set, it is a text file.
If the second is set, it's Integer.
Third is applesoft, fourth is binary.
If the eigth or MSB is set, the file
is locked. It's really quite simple.
$00 means a text file. $80 means a
locked text file. If it is a $84,
we have a locked binary file.

 Now for the complicated stuff, how
DOS writes sectors, INITs a disk,
the "6 & 2" split. Lets say you put a
blank disk in the drive, initialized
it, and saved a file onto it. Lets see
what happens. First off, at $A54F is
the INIT routine. If you did A54FG
from monitor, it would INIT your disk
without a hello program. This lets
your disk boot faster because it does
not have to load in that file.
Ok. So you type in "INIT HELLO". DOS
takes over and starts formatting your
disk starting with track 0 and ending
with track $23. Then it writes the
catalog track and VTOC. Last it writes
in DOS. Lets take a close look at a
disk at the track level. First off we
have what is called a GAP. This is made
up of "FF"'s. Then we have the prolouge
marks, ye olde "D5 AA 96". After that
comes the volume, track, sector, check-
sum, epilouge "DE AA EB". Then comes a
smaller GAP with a different prolouge
"D5 AA AD". Then $342 bytes of user
data. Oops! $342 bytes of user data?
I thought there were only $FF or 255
bytes per sector! (more on this later).
Then we have the checksum. And last
we have the epilouge "DE AA EB".
There are certain bytes that DOS
doesn't write as data. These bytes are
used in proulouge and epilouge marks.
DOS looks for these when trying to find
a sector. Now for the "6 & 2" split.
The hardware on the apple doesn't allow
for more than $3F different bytes to
be written. That's why they used the
"5 & 3" split on 3.2 disks. What that
means is that from one byte, five bits
are taken out and form one byte. The
other three bits form one byte also.
The six and two split is the same thing
as the five and three but allows for
more combinations.

 Now for a little on copy protection.
Back in the good 'ol days we could just
demuffin everything. All they had was
a modified DOS or changed address marks
etc. After that they got a little
smarter and some wrote their own DOS
or used a modified RWTS. But nothing
stops us pirates, all you had to do
is read in data through their RWTS and
write it back out standard. Then they
got dirty, using the text page and the
input buffer for data or code. They
even used the stack (page 1) for code.
To get around this, NMI card like
crackshot and cracking chips were made.
these dumped all memory to disk allow-
ing the text page and the input buffer
to be undisturbed. The newest thing
seems to be SPIRAL TRACKING. The first
game I saw this on was Maze Craze.
Cracking it was quite easy though. All
you had to do is cut out one part of
disk access (at $855) that wasn't even
needed. But who knows what we will be
up against in the future.

 I suggest you read "Beneath Apple DOS"
 and look at the DOS manual supplied
with your Apple. This is for beginners
or people who are too lazy to read
a book...

 I would appreciate lots of questions,
I may not have made myself too clear
or you may want to know more about
a certain area. Just leave me e-mail.

   The Freeze

       D O S     T R I C K S        
 
 TRY THIS TO SEE ANY DOS, REMOVE THE
REAR MOST SET OF RAM CHIPS FROM YOUR
APPLE (THE ONES NEAR THE I/O SLOTS).
THEN INIT A DISK, REPLACE THE RAM AND
BOOT UP UNDER THE PROGRAM YOU WISH TO
DEPROTECT. THEN FORCE A REBOOT WITH THE
DISK YOU INITED IN DRIVE 1. THE DOS 
FROM THE PROTECTED DISK WILL (IN MOST
CASES) STILL BE IN THE RAM UP TOP....
 
THIS NEW DOS IS A SLAVE AT 32 K AND
THE OLD (AND PROTECTED DOS) IS STILL
AT 48 K. THIS WILL WORK ON ABOUT 50%
OF THE PROGRAMS.  ENJOY
 

YOU CAN ALSO REMOVE THE TOP 32K AND
GET TWICE AS MUCH.

=======================================
CHECKSUM TRICK

A  VERY  HANDY TECHNIQUE FOR  TAKING  A
LOOK AT THE DATA ON A PROTECTED DISK IS
TO  DISABLE  THE CHECKSUM IN THE  RWTS.
THE  FORMATS  OF MANY  PROTECTED  DISKS
VARY ONLY IN THIS CHECKSUM,  SO TURNING
IT   OFF  SHOULD  ALLOW  ANY   STANDARD
TRACK/SECTOR  UTILITY  TO LOOK  AT  THE
DISK!  TO DO THIS, BOOT UP THE DOS THAT
YOU WISH TO USE, AND ENTER THE MONITOR.
THEN  ENTER   B942:18 FOR  DOS  3.3  OR
B963:18  FOR DOS 3.2.   THIS CHANGES  A
SET  CARRY INSTRUCTION TO A CLEAR CARRY
INSTRUCTION.  NOW RETURN TO DOS AND RUN
YOUR  EDITOR.   IF  THE  DISK  YOU  ARE
LOOKING  AT  IS  PROTECTED  WITH   THIS
SYSTEM,  YOU  SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ IT
NOW. TO MAKE  THIS CHANGE TO A DOS ON A
DISK, THIS DATA IS CONTAINED IN TRACK 0
SECTOR  3,  AT EITHER BYTE $42 OR  BYTE
$63, FOR DOS 3.3 OR 3.2, RESPECTIVELY.
GOOD LUCK.......
                     RANDY

=======================================

TO AVOID RE-LOADING THE LANGUAGE CARD
ON BOOTUP ( A MAJOR IRRITATION )
CHANGE THE FOLLOWING :
 
 
IN A 48K SYSTEM, CHANGE $BFCC TO 00 AND
$BFCF TO 00 : THIS WILL PREVENT THE 
LANGUAGE CARD FROM BEING WRITTEN TO.
(INITIALIZE A DISKETTE WITH THIS DO
 TO MAKE IT BOOT UP IN THIS FASHION)
 
(IF YOU LOOK AT THE CODE, YOU CAN MAKE 
THE SAME MODS IN A COPY OF A SYST
MASTER ON THE DISK ITSELF, SO A MASTER
CREATE WILL PUT THIS DOS ON A DISKETTE.
CHANGE THE CODE THAT SAYS LDA C081 WITH
LDA C000 -- THAT SSHOULD WORK FINE.
 
=======================================

GET INTO MONITOR FROM A NORMAL DISK.
TYPE:   400<A800.ABFFM
 
POOF THERE YOU HAVE ALL THE DOS COMANDS
NOTICE THAT ALL THE LETTERS IN THE
COMAND ARE FLASHING BUT THE LAST ONE
THAT IS TO TELL YOU WHERE THE COMAND
ENDS. NOW NOTICE WHERE THE INIT,LOAD,
BLOAD,SAVE,BSAVE,CATALOG, ETC...
THEN BOOT SOMETHING LIKE BRAIN SURGEON
OR SOMETHING THAT HAS SOMETHING LIKE
A NORMAL FORMAT THEN TYPE THAT LINE
AND THEN YOU CAN SEE IF THEY CHANGED
ANY OF THE COMANDS!

COSMOS PROVIDES A LANGUAGE BY MEAN OF 
WHICH A USER CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE 
SYSTEM. THE LANGUAGE INCLUDES VARIOUS
PREFIXES AS WELL AS INPUT FORMATS AND

MSG LEFT BY: SALLY RIDE
DATE POSTED: 

INPUT VALUES. PREFIXES ARE ABBREVIATION
WHICH REPRESENT SPECIFIC DATA CATAGORIE
TO THE SYSTEM WHEN INPUT BY THE USER. 
AN EXAMPLE OF A PREFIX IS "TN"WHICH 
MEANS "TELEPHONE NUMBER". AN INPUT 
FORMAT DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF CHARAC-
TERS FOLLOWING A PREFIX AS WELL AS THE
PATTERN IN WHICH THESE MUST BE ENTERED.
FOR EXAMPLE, "TN XXX-XXXX" MEANS THAT 
THE PREFIX "TN" MUST BE FOLLOWED BY 
SEVEN CHARACTERS IN THE FORMAT SHOWN.
 
INPUT VALUES ARE THE ALLOWABLE DATA
ENTERED FOR EACH PREFIX IN THE CORRECT
INPUT FORMAT. AS MENTIONED IN THE 
PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH THE INPUT FORMAT
FOR THE PREFIX "TN" IS "TN XXX-XXXX"
THE FIRST THREE CHARACTERS (XXX) MUST
BE ALPHANUMERIC; THE LAST FOUR (XXXX)
MUST BE NUMERIC. SO, COSMOS WOULD CON-
SIDER AN INPUT OF "TN 935-2481" AS
VALID INPUT. BUT YOU *MUST* USE THE
CORRECT WIRE CENTER FOR THE (XXX) IN 
QUESTION. IN HACKING COSMOS PART 2
LEX WILL HAVE A LIST OF THE MOST 
COMMONLY USED PREFIXES, FORMATS AND
PREFIX CODE VALUES WHICH ENABLE YOU
TO READ AND UNDERSTAND COSMOS TRANS-
ACTIONS.

             STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO BACKING-UP DISKS
                              WITH
                         NIBBLES AWAY ][

     THERE ARE THREE BASIC STEPS TO BACKUP A DISKETTE:

1. LOCATE THE TRACKS WHICH CONTAIN DATA.
2. FIND THE ADDRESS MARKER FOR THE SECTORS THERE.
3. FIGURE OUT ANY ADDITIONAL PROTECTION.

(HINT: #3 IS THE HARD ONE!)

     FOR  MOST  OF  THE PROCEDURES BELOW,  A BASIC WORKING  KNOWLEDGE  OF  THE
TRACK/BIT EDITOR (TBE) IS REQUIRED.   FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH  THE
TBE,  AN OVERALL DESCRIPTION AND SOME EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN BELOW.   THE EXAMPLES
ARE  EASIER TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY ARE PERFORMED AS YOU READ THIS,  SO YOU  MAY
WANT TO BOOT UP NIBBLES AWAY ][ AND TRY THEM OUT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT IS GOING ON.

     ENTER  THE  TBE  BY SELECTING OPTION 'T' FROM THE  MAIN  MENU.   A  LARGE
SECTION  OF  NUMBERS WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN,  WITH TWO DASHED LINES AT  THE
TOP.   THE  INFORMATION IN BETWEEN THESE LINES IS THE STATUS  INFORMATION  AND
INFORMS YOU OF SUCH THINGS AS CURSOR POSITION,  TRACK NUMBER,  AND IS ALSO THE
LOCATION  WHERE VARIOUS PROMPTS APPEAR FOR CERTAIN FUNCTIONS.   THE NUMBERS AT
THE  BOTTOM  ARE SEPARATED INTO TWO SECTIONS.   ON THE LEFT ARE  THE  STARTING
MEMORY  ADDRESS'S FOR EACH LINE TO THE RIGHT.   MOVE THE CURSOR  AROUND  USING
I,J,K OR M, AND WATCH THE ADDR INDICATOR IN THE STATUS LINE.  IT WILL TELL YOU
EXACTLY WHAT MEMORY ADDRESS THE VALUE UNDER THE CURSOR REPRESENTS.   THE ARROW
KEYS  CHANGE THE AREA OF MEMORY WHICH YOU CAN SEE.   THEY SHIFT YOUR VIEW  256
BYTES FORWARD OR BACKWARD AT A TIME.   THE ONLY REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW
FOR  THIS DISCUSSION IS HOW TO USE THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE THE VIEWING 'WINDOW'
AROUND IN MEMORY.
     THE  ';'  (UNSHIFTED '+') AND THE '-' KEYS INCREMENT  AND  DECREMENT  THE
TRACK  NUMBER IN THE STATUS LINE.   PRESSING 'R' WILL CAUSE DRIVE ONE TO  READ
THE  DATA FROM THE TRACK INDICATED IN THE STATUS LINE INTO MEMORY.   THE BYTES
ON THE SCREEN WILL CHANGE,  SINCE DIFFERENT DATA HAS BEEN READ  IN.   PRESSING
THE  'R'  KEY  MULTIPLE TIMES WILL RESULT IN DIFFERENT DATA  BEING  DISPLAYED.
THIS IS BECAUSE NIBBLES AWAY ][ STARTS READING AT WHATEVER POINT HAPPENS TO BE
UNDER THE HEAD WHEN THE DRIVE IS TURNED ON,  WHICH IS RANDOM, HENCE THE CHANGE
IN  THE  DISPLAYED DATA (THE DATA IS NOT ACTUALLY DIFFERENT,  IT IS  JUST  NOT
LOADED AT THE SAME MEMORY LOCATION AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY).

STEP 1:
     TO  DO  THIS WE MUST LOCATE ALL OF THE TRACKS ON THE DISK  WHICH  CONTAIN
DATA.   TO DO THIS WE SHOULD HAVE THE TRACK POINTER SET TO TRACK 00.  PRESSING
'R'  WILL READ IN THE TRACK AND SHOW IT ON THE SCREEN.   THE ARROW KEYS SHOULD
BE  USED  TO MOVE THE VIEWING 'WINDOW' TO START AT $2000.   NOW WE  WILL  MOVE
FORWARD  AND TRY TO DETERMINE IF THIS TRACK CONTAINS  VALID  DATA.   ACTUALLY,
TRACK 00 MUST CONTAIN SOME DATA IN ORDER FOR THE DISK TO BOOT,  BUT WE WILL BE
USING THIS PROCEDURE ON OTHER TRACKS WHICH DO NOT NECESSARILY CONTAIN DATA.
     THE  MAIN  THING  WHICH WILL IDENTIFY A TRACK AS CONTAINING DATA  IS  THE
PRESENCE OF GAPS.   GAPS ARE SECTIONS OF THE SAME BYTE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES.
NORMALLY THEY ARE MADE UP OF $FF'S AND ARE 6-20 IN LENGTH.   TO SEE WHAT THESE
LOOK  LIKE,  INSERT YOUR SYSTEM MASTER DISK AND READ IN TRACK 00 AS  DESCRIBED
ABOVE.   MOVING  THROUGH  THE BUFFER WITH THE ARROW KEYS WILL REVEAL  A  LARGE
VARIETY  OF VALUES.   SPACED OUT AMONG THESE SHOULD BE SECTIONS OF FF'S  WHICH
CONTAIN ABOUT 6-20 IN A ROW,  DEPENDING ON THE EXACT DISK.   NORMALLY DOS  3.2
DISKS HAVE LARGER GAPS THAN DOS 3.3 DISKS.  THERE SHOULD BE MANY OCCURANCES OF
THE  GAPS,  SPACED OUT SO THAT YOU SEE ONE ABOUT EVERY OTHER TIME THAT YOU USE
THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE FORWARD OR BACKWARD.

NOTE:YOU  MAY SEE A SECOND,  SMALLER (2-5 $FF'S),  GAP FOLLOWING A LARGE  GAP,
     WITH  A SMALL SECTION OF DATA IN BETWEEN.   THIS IS CALLED THE  SECONDARY
     GAP.   WHEN  REFERING TO A GAP HERE,  WE WILL ALWAYS BE TALKING ABOUT THE
     PRIMARY GAP, NOT THE SECONDARY ONE.

     NOW TRY LOOKING AT OTHER TRACKS ON THE DISK.  FIRST LOOK ONLY AT THE FULL
TRACKS  (NO .5 ON THE END).   ALL OF THEM WILL BE SIMILAR TO TRACK 00  IN  THE
APPEARANCE  OF  THE GAPS.   YOU MAY WANT TO TRY THIS SEVERAL TIMES  TO  BECOME
COMFORTABLE WITH LOCATING GAPS ON A GIVEN TRACK.
     NOW READ IN A HALF TRACK (.5 ON THE END).   SCAN MEMORY TO LACATE SOME OF
THE GAPS.  SINCE SYSTEM MASTER DISKS DO NOT USE HALF-TRACKS, THE DATA WHICH WE
SEE HERE IS REALLY 'CROSS-TALK'.  IN OTHER WORDS, DATA WAS WRITTEN ON THE FULL
TRACK,  BUT  THE  MAGNETIC PATTERN SPREAD OUT A BIT,  AND SO WE SEE SOME  DATA
HERE.   THE TELL-TALE SIGN OF THIS PHENOMENA IS THAT THE GAPS WILL NOT BE  ALL
THE  SAME.   THAT IS,  THEY MAY HAVE ONE OR MORE VALUES IN THEM WHICH ARE  NOT
CONSISTENT.   THIS TELLS US THAT THERE IS SOME DATA ON THIS TRACK, BUT THAT IT
IS NOT VALID DATA.  TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OTHER HALF-TRACKS SO THAT YOU CAN TELL
IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT A FULL TRACK OR A HALF TRACK BY EXAMINING THE GAPS.
     THE NEXT ITEM WHICH YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IS A BLANK TRACK.  TO
DO THIS, INSERT A BLANK (NON-INITIALIZED) DISK INTO DRIVE ONE.  READ ANY TRACK
ON  THIS  DISK AND SCAN THROUGH THE MEMORY ADDRESSES.   THERE WILL BE NO  GAPS
FOUND,  AND  MANY OF THE BYTES SEEN ON A TRACK LIKE THIS WILL END IN  0  (I.E.
$A0,$B0,$E0),  WHICH ARE NOT LEGAL DISK BYTES.  THIS MEANS THAT THE CONTROLLER
CAN FIND NO VALID DATA ON THE TRACK.  SOME DISKS HAVE PORTIONS OF TRACKS WHICH
ARE NOT USED,  SO YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE SURE TO EXAMINE AT LEAST 24 SCREENFULLS
OF INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO DATA AT ANY POINT ON THE TRACK.
     OUR  NEXT  TOOL FOR FINDING DATA IS THE FACT THAT VALID DATA MUST  BE  AT
LEAST 1 TRACK APART.   IN OTHER WORDS,  IF YOU LOCATE DATA ON TRACK 3.5,  THEN
TRACK  4  CANNOT HAVE DATA AND THE NEXT PLACE WHERE DATA CAN BE IS TRACK  4.5.
THIS IS VERY HELPFUL FOR FINDING TRACKS WITH DATA.

NOTE: IF  YOU LOCATE DATA ON A GIVEN TRACK,  IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO LOOK AT  THE
     TRACKS  ONE HALF TRACK TO EITHER SIDE,  TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY LOOK  LESS
     VALID THAN THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE SELECTED AS THE REAL ONE.

     WELL,  NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO LOACATE DATA ON A TRACK,  WE CAN BEGIN  AT
TRACK 0 AND STEP TOWARDS TRACK 22, CHECKING EACH TRACK TO SEE IF IT APPEARS TO
HAVE DATA ON IT.   MOST DISKS HAVE A PATTERN TO THE POSITION OF THE DATA,  AND
IF  YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT,  YOU MAY BE ABLE TO JUST CHECK A FEW TRACKS TO MAKE
SURE,  AND THEN GO ON TO STEP 2.  OTHERWISE THE DATA MUST BE LOCATED ONE TRACK
AT A TIME.
     MOST  DISKS USE THE STANDARD TRACKS (1,2,3,...,22),  BUT THERE  ARE  SOME
WHICH  USE HALF-TRACKS AND SOME WHICH USE ALL THE WAY OUT TO TRACK 23  (WHICH,
BY  THE WAY CANNOT BE READ ON ALL DRIVES SINCE NO DRIVES WERE EVER DESIGNED TO
GO OUT THAT FAR).
     WHEN ALL TRACKS WHICH CONTAIN SOME TYPE OF DATA ARE LOCATED,  WE CAN MOVE
ON TO STEP 2.

STEP 2:
     NOW  WE  MUST  TELL NIBBLES AWAY ][ HOW TO READ THE  INFORMATION  ON  THE
TRACKS WHICH WE HAVE FOUND TO CONTAIN VALID DATA.   THIS IS DONE BY GOING BACK
TO  EACH  OF THESE TRACKS WITH THE TBE AND FINDING THE ADDRESS MARK  FOR  EACH
ONE.   THE ADDRESS MARK WILL BE THE FIRST 3 BYTES FOLLOWING THE GAP.   TO  SEE
THIS IN OPERATION, TAKE A LOOK AT A TRACK FROM YOUR SYSTEM MASTER DISK.  AFTER
EACH  GAP YOU WILL SEE EITHER 'D5 AA 96' FOR A DOS 3.3 MASTER DISK,  OR 'D5 AA
B5' FOR A DOS 3.2 DISK.   THESE VALUES SHOULD BE NOTED DOWN ALONGSIDE OF  EACH
TRACK NUMBER WHICH CONTAINS DATA.  MANY TIMES THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE, OR MAYBE
2 PATTERNS FOR ALL TRACKS.
     AFTER  THIS,  WE  ARE  READY TO BACK-UP THESE TRACKS.   THIS IS  DONE  BY
EXITING THE TBE (USE 'Q') AND THEN SELECTING 'M' FOR THE MODIFIERS MENU.  THEN
SELECT 'B' FOR BACKUP MODIFIER.   WHEN ASKED 'USE ADDRESS MARK' ANSWER 'Y' AND
THEN TYPE IN THE ADDRESS MARK WHICH YOU NOTED DOWN FOR THE RANGE OF TRACKS  TO
BE  BACKED-UP.   SIMPLY  PRESS  RETURN TO THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS  AND  THEN
RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU.   SELECT 'N' TO ENTER NIBBLES AWAY ][, AND ANSWER 'Y'
TO THE QUESTION 'CHANGE DEFAULT OPTIONS'.  USE THE <RETURN> KEY TO MOVE TO THE
'START TRACK' PROMPT,  AND THEN ENTER THE FIRST TRACK TO BE BACKED-UP.   PRESS
RETURN  AND  THEN  TYPE IN THE LAST TRACK TO BE  BACKED-UP  WITH  THE  CURRENT
ADDRESS  MARKER SETTING.   IF THE TRACKS IN THE SPECIFIED RANGE ARE NOT SPACED
AT  1  TRACK INTERVALS,  ENTER THE INTERVAL AT THE 'TRACK  INCREMENT'  PROMPT.
PRESS RETURN FOR THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND BEGIN THE BACKUP AFTER  INSERTING
THE DISKS WHEN PROMPTED.   WHEN YOU RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU,  REPEAT THE ABOVE
PROCEDURE  FOR EACH RANGE OF TRACKS WHICH CONTAINS A DIFFERENT ADDRESS MARKER.
     NOW COMES THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!  TRY TO BOOT UP THE BACKED-UP DISK (IF THE
ORIGINAL  HAD A WRITE-PROTECT TAB,  THE BACK-UP SHOULD TOO!).   IF THE  BACKUP
BOOTS, THEN ALL WENT SUCCESFULLY.

STEP 3:
     IF THE BACK-UP DID NOT WORK PROPERLY THEN THERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO  LOOK
FOR.

1....DID  ALL  OF THE TRACKS WHICH SHOULD HAVE BACKED-UP DO SO?   THIS CAN  BE
     SEEN  WHILE THE BACK-UP TAKES PLACE AS A 'Y' OR AN 'N' UNDER THAT  TRACKS
     STATUS LOCATION.   IF SOME DID NOT,  THEN THE ADDRESS MARKER WAS PROBABLY
     NOT DETERMINED PROPERLY.   IF THIS IS THE CASE,  THEN GO BACK TO THE  TBE
     AND TRY THOSE TRACKS AGAIN.
2....IF EVERYTHING SEEMED TO GO WELL,  BUT THE BACKUP REFUSES TO WORK (YOU MAY
     WANT  TO TRY THE PROCEDURE AGAIN,  MAYBE WITH THE SOURCE AND  DESTINATION
     DRIVES  REVERSED,  TO  MAKE SURE IT WAS NOT A POWER GLITCH OR OTHER  SUCH
     OCCURANCE  WHICH MESSED THINGS UP) THE NEXT STEP IS TO TRY THE  PROCEDURE
     WITH  THE  'SYNCHRONIZED COPY' OPTION SELECTED.   DISKS  WHICH  USE  THIS
     METHOD  OFTEN  MAKE VIOLENT HEAD MOVEMENTS DURING THEIR  BOOT  PROCEDURE.
     THIS CAN BE A CLUE TO THIS TYPE OF PROTECTION.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
     ON  SOME DOS 3.3 DISKETTES,  THE GAPS BETWEEN THE SECTORS ARE REDUCED  IN
SIZE.   IN  SOME  CASES  THEY  CAN  BE  AS  SMALL  AS  4  OR  5  BYTES.   WHEN
NIBBLES  AWAY ][ FINDS THE BEGINNING OF A SECTION OF DATA,  IT NORMALLY ADDS 8
BYTES  OF SYNC JUST BEFORE THE DATA.   THIS WILL NORMALLY PUT SYNC BYTES  INTO
THE  GAP BEFORE THE DATA,  WHERE IT SHOULD BE.   HOWEVER,  IF A DISK HAS  VERY
SMALL GAPS,  THEN THE ADDED SYNC CAN OVERWRITE THE END OF THE PREVIOUS SECTOR.
THE PARAMETER FIX AMNT CONTROLS THE NUMBER OF SYNC BYTES WHICH ARE  ADDED,  SO
THIS  VALUE  CAN BE REDUCED TO PREVENT ANY DATA FROM BEING  OVERWRITTEN.   THE
VALUE THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ USES FOR THE SYNC WHICH IT PUTS IN IS CONTAINED  IN
THE  PARAMETER  FIX VALU.   NORMALLY THIS IS A $7F,  BUT IT CAN BE SET TO  ANY
DESIRED VALUE.
    IT  SHOULD BE NOTED THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ REGARDS ANY DATA BYTE  WHICH  HAS
ITS HIGH BIT CLEARED TO BE A SYNC BYTE.   SO THE $7F WHICH IS NORMALLY IN THIS
PARAMETER MEANS THAT A SYNC $FF IS TO BE ADDED.  IF THE 'OVERIDE STANDARDIZER'
OPTION  IS  SELECTED,  THEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ WILL NOT ADD ANY  BYTES,  IT  WILL
SIMPLY  CONVERT THE DATA WHICH IS PRESENT BEFORE A SECTOR INTO  SYNC,  WITHOUT
CHANGING ITS VALUE.   THIS TECHNIQUE CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DISKS WHOSE GAPS ARE
VERY SMALL.

     ANOTHER  ITEM TO WATCH FOR IS DISKS WHOSE TRACKS APPEAR TO BE VERY  LONG.
SOME DISK PROTECTION SCHEMES PUT GARBAGE ON A PORTION OF THE TRACK.  WHEN THIS
GARBAGE  IS  READ BACK,  MORE BYTES ARE READ IN THAN WERE WRITTEN  OUT.   THIS
CAUSES  THE TRACK TO BE LONGER THAN NORMAL,  AND IN SOME CASES IT  BECOMES  SO
LONG  THAT  THE  DEFAULT PARAMETERS FOR NIBBLES AWAY ][ CANNOT FIND  THE  DATA
PROPERLY.   THE  PARAMETERS  DATA  MIN AND DATA MAX CONTROL  THE  MINUMUM  AND
MAXIMUM TRACK LENGTHS (IN INCREMENTS OF 256 BYTES) WHICH NIBBLES AWAY ][  WILL
ACCOMODATE.   THE  NORMAL VALUE OF DATA MAX IS $1D,  BUT THIS CAN BE SET TO  A
HIGHER VALUE,  SUCH AS $25,  IF A TRACK APPEARS TO BE VERY LONG.   EVEN THOUGH
THE  TRACK  MAY  READ IN AS A LARGE NUMBER OF BYTES,  MANY OF  THESE  WILL  BE
REMOVED BY THE NIBBLE FILTER,  SINCE THEY ARE GARBAGE BYTES.  THIS WILL ASSURE
THAT  THE  AMOUNT OF DATA WRITTEN BACK OUT WILL NOT BE TO LARGE TO FIT ON  THE
DESTINATION TRACK.

     WHEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ FINDS A SECTOR OF DATA, IT LOOKS FORWARD IN THE DATA
TO FIND A SECOND OCCURANCE OF THE SAME PATTERN.   THIS INSURES THAT THE SECTOR
HAS  BEEN READ IN AND LOCATED CORRECTLY.   ON MANY DISKS,  THERE IS A  PRIMARY
SECTION  OF  DATA,  CALLED THE ADDRESS FIELD,  AND THE THE ACTUAL  DATA  FIELD
FOLLOWS.   IN BETWEEN THESE IS A SMALL GAP,  AND MANY TIMES IT CONTAINS RANDOM
INFORMATION.   THIS MEANS THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ SHOULD ONLY MATCH THE NUMBER OF
BYTES WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE ADDRESS FIELD, SINCE THE BYTES IN THE GAP MAY NOT
READ AS THE SAME VALUE EVERY TIME.  THE PARAMETER FIND MAX CONTROLS THE NUMBER
OF  BYTES WHICH ARE CHECKED DURING THIS PROCEDURE.   THE DEFAULT VALUE OF  $0C
WORKS  IN  MOST CASES,  BUT SOME DISKS USE A SMALLER ADDRESS FIELD  WHICH  MAY
REQUIRE  THIS  PARAMETER  TO BE SET TO A  SMALLER  VALUE.   HOWEVER,  IF  THIS
PARAMETER  IS SET TOO LOW,  THEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ MAY IDENTIFY THE MATCH FOR  A
SECTION OF DATA WHOSE FIRST FEW BYTES ARE THE SAME, BUT WHICH DIFFER LATER ON.
THEREFORE ONE SHOULD EXCERSIZE CAUTION WHEN LOWERING THIS VALUE.

         FUN STUFF FOR SYSOPS
---------------------------------------
First, you must be a sysop. 
(Obviously!) Or, you may be at a 
sysop's house (When he or she is not
around.)

Second, you must be VERY popular,
or VERY daring. Either way, your
victim will have a strong dendency
to: a) crash your board, b) hate you, 
or c) spread malicious rumors about
you, and, or your board to everyone
in the world that will listen.
 
    I am going to write about AE
fun first, and then Net-Worx. 
 
 
                AE Fun
                -- ---
 
    So you are bored, and want to
have some fun, huh?
    Go into your room, or wherever
you have your apple, and sit down.
Turn on the monitor, and lets see
if there is a leech on the line.
(-note: if you are the unlucky type,
I suggest that you give this up,
because for all you know, that sysop
of the 20meg board is on your line,
and he's going to be your victim!!)
   Now for some of these pranks, you
will need to make things before-
hand. I suggest you read this through,
and make the necessary mods. 
 
1) This one is probably my meanest
trick, and should only be used on
people like Matt Ackerett, or Little
Al.
   Your victim has to be leeching
a game off of your AE for this to
work.
   You wait until your victim is at
his last 2 blocks of memeory to go
until the transfer is done, and
you take out the disk. 
   This will ruin the >entire<
transmission. It won't piss them off
too bad if it is only 50 or so blocks,
but can you imagine:
 
Send: Matt Ackerett is a fag
290 blocks
crc=167
<289>
 
    Note- The victim has to get 290
blocks, you only let the victim get
289!
 
 
   At that point, take out the disk!
They have just waited 1/2 hour for
nothing! They can't get the last block
and have to go through the whole
thing again!! Ha ha!  
   This is very mean, especially if
they aren't phreaking, they have
been >paying< for it all!
 
             
2) If you want to see if the person
on is intelligent...simply let him
catalog your drive once, then when he
is done, take the disk out, and 
put in the disk from the other drive.
When they catalog the disk next, it 
will be different!
   This will freak them out, they will
think that they have switched to d1
somehow. The victim will then L)og the
drive, and find it still on D2. Wow!
   Hopefully they will catalog D1 
anyway, thinking that they were
originally on D1 and it switched.
Now comes the fun. 
   Put the right disk back in D2, 
and put the disk that used to be in D2
into D1, so they will get the same 
catalog.
   Now they are confused. Now
they will catalog D2, and find the
normal stuff. Hopefull they will
read something, now take the disk
out while they are typing in the name,
and slip the other disk in. It
will say 'file not found.'
   Good. Now they will catalog it,
and look! The wares have changed!
Now something is wrong here! They
will say:
 
hey! stop it!
 
   Oh no! They are on to your scheme!
But, 1 last joke! Get a copy-protected
type disk, one that you <gasp> bought.
They won't be able to catalog this
at all! Ha!
   If they get mad, they might
say something like:
 
        Hey! Stop it!
   
   But will you listen? nnnoooooo!
Take the disk out, and slip something
totally new, preferably the disk that
has "sneakers" or some ancient wares.
Maybe they will think these are the
latest! Watch them post!:
 
      Hey! I just got some new 
      Warez! Do you want to trade??
 
hah hah!
 
  Satisfied, you may put the normal
disks back in and walk off to see
some football game.
 
3) Lock out the space-bar. This will
make it so that they can't type a
<space>. Then, they can't read
anything that requires a space. 
Most likely the victim will think that
there is something wrong with >his< 
computer. Thusly sending him/her/it
into a 1/2 hour scan of their install
program to see what is wrong.
 
4) Change the commands...such as:
 
d)irectory= c)irectory
-           -
 
   They will have to hack at the 
commands! This won't be too funny,
because they won't do anything stupid
like posting:
 
     hey your commands are screwed!
  
   Most likely they wont find the 
command for 'copy'.
 
 
5) lock out the "ctrl-c". This will
piss them off when the victim just
can't exit from posting. Ha!
 
6) Change the ring count, most, or
almost >all< AE lines are set to 
pick up after just 1 ring. Change it
to...say...5 rings, and only tell your
friends that it is at 5 rings. When
they call, they will only wait for 
about 2 rings, and hang up thinking
that the line is down. Only the people
you like will get on, because they 
will be the only ones to wait 5 rings.
Mean huh?
 
7) When someone is posting, or c)opy-
ing a message, pick up the voice line,
and blow into the reciever. This will
put all of these weird characters onto
the screen. He will save a gay looking
message, that will make it look like
the victim can't type!! 
 
 
               Net Works
               --- -----
 
   I don't have as many fun tricks
with net-worx as I do with AE, but
here are a couple of my favorites...
 
1) In the program, make a bug, like
"ctrl-k" that when pushed (like ctrl-t
for chat) it will dump you into basic.
take out the disks, and put in like 
the "bare-bones" net-worx disk and let
them have fun reading fake messages,
mail, and passwords. Ooooh! They will
think:
 
oh yay! I have everyone's pass!
 
Now, see if he/she will init the 
disks, if they do, you know what type
of user it is. If they are nice,
and 'hang' the line for you so that
no one wil be able to get on after,
or they try to beep you, then give 
them a level raise.
 
2) Be a tyrant. Juggle their levels
while they are on. Like break into
chat, change their level, and watch
them get all mad. 
 
3) Break into chat, and just walk off,
leaving a frustrated user sitting
there.
 
4) break into chat, and change the
time. In other words, leave them
with -10 minutes, instead of 35 or
so.
 
5) when they log off, and they get
that stupid message about:
 
            Thank you for
              calling
 
and all of that, press 'ctrl-c' a
few times, and they will be brought
back. Wow! What happened? Let them
try to log off a few times nd keep
pressing ctrl-c. Finally they should
just press 'reset'. He he!
 
 
    I hope you have enjoyed these
little pranks. Your users will hate
you if you do this too often, unless
they are like Matt Ackeret or Little
Al. Then it doesn't matter much.
    Remember! I hold no responsibilty
for people wanting to crash your 
system because they are so pissed
at you!

     Greetings.  A lot of work went into this file.  I spent many long nights
tracking down these little gems that to this day still leave me smiling.
They are the last undiscovered relic of the Apple pirate world.  They remain
hidden on your disks, unknown, unrealized, waiting to be discovered, perhaps
finally now, perhaps never.  Never to be known by anyone except for the
person who planted it in the first place.  Call me weird, but there's a
certain mystique about them.  Its like finding an old coin buried in your
back yard:  it was there, waiting to be dug up,  and you didn't even realize
it.  Or finding that last easter egg (hence the name) on that certain Sunday
when you were but a little guy.  I am speaking of what I prefer to call
"secret keys".  I always got off on finding the things.  To think that years
ago, someone, somewhere, added something a little special to their work for
someone to find later is, well, real neat.

     This file is older than promises of an upgrade for the //gs...literally
(by the way, those of you still holding out hope, give it up).  I finally
felt it was time to put aside my perfectionist tendencies and put it out with
some incomplete or un-researched entries.  I used to tirelessly pursue every
lead I could in order to track down secret keys and the like; calling
different pirate friends around the country and asking them about ones I had
heard rumors of; searching disks sector by sector looking for funny or
interesting messages; boot tracing nearly every single one of my cracked
games to see if the title page routine included some check for a special
keypress.  I put a lot of time and effort into this file, and hope that the
few people who will take the time to read it will possibly gain some
enjoyment from checking out these gems for themselves.  This file was started
almost two years ago (I can't believe it myself).  If you're like me, you
still have most of these games or programs stuffed away in disk cases that
you rarely dig into anymore (mine make great dust collectors).  Now you have
a chance to re-live some of those fond memories of playing cool Apple games
well into the wee hours.  Perhaps not, but give it a whirl anyway, you might
enjoy some of the things you discover for the first time.

     A lot of these games are ancient (some a decade old!) and you probably
don't and won't ever have them.  I do have most of them (except for the GS
stuff...I don't have a GS and probably never will unless I can get one for
under $100...any offers?)  Of course, some of the more obscure hardware
easter eggs will be a challenge for those of you who will attempt to
experience every single secret key documented in this file.  As if anyone is
actually going to try, but if you are, try going to your school or some place
where they have old outdated Apple's.  You may even find some of the older
games still making the rounds in programming class when the twits should be
coding rather than playing Mario Bros.

     I had hoped to make this guide as complete and up-to-date as possible,
but considering its been aeons since I last touched it, I felt I may as well
release it now or never release it at all.  I don't know what kind of
audience this file will receive, but I hope the few people who do take the
time to get it are pleased with the effort I took to present them with these
gems and hope they enjoy them as much as I do.

     The Apple Pirate world was a killer playground for me: all the different
BBS' and the interesting types I met in different corners of the country.
The dead and lonely back-alley wares boards and the thriving elyte message
systems.  There will never be another community, another sub-society like it.
The 80's were a decade of advancement for all computers, but Apples and Apple
users led the way.  Apple users were the innovators, the originators.  The
pirate code of honor (and dishonor) that spawned from the Apple world, all
the words (K-K00L!), customs (crack screens and rag pages) found their way
into many different areas of the computer world as a whole.  Atari and
Commodore 64 groups hoped to only come close to the rich Apple pirate
traditions.  Oh, the bustling commerce of wares being traded between
different warehouse Meccas of pirated games!  But of course, all empires must
fall, or be absorbed into a greater whole.

     Near the end, other computers' pirating customs began spilling back
into the Apple realm, and it was completely lame.  But by then, the Apple
world was pretty much extinct anyway, only being carried on by those die-hard
romantics hoping to effect some sort of revival.  Now the Apple modem world
is but a ghost of what it once was.  Lonely, desolate, Apple BBS' are few and
far between.  I sometimes call out, now only to one and sometimes two Apple
BBS'.  The Apple may be dead, but then, so are a lot of other computers.  The
90s are here, man.  Things are changing real fast.  Apple and IBM working
together?  MicroSoft and IBM, splitsville?  Its so diverse out there now.
Don't hold back.  Use your Apple experience as a stepping stone onto other
platforms.  There's so much out there to try...

     Well, I got carried away, but since this is in all likelihood my last
major Apple world contribution, what the fuck.


                             :Acknowledgements:

Thanks to Hot Rod (where ever the hell he is these days) for publishing the
first secret key files and turning me on to this entertaining pastime and
for finding all the secret keys he did.  Also, thanks go to Apple Core for
the secret keys he found and published in his "Secret Game Keys" file.
Finally, thanks to the many people that informed me of new ones I hadn't
known about.  This file basically compiles all previously published secret
keys plus the few ones I have located into this one source guide.


These are the different types of "Easter Eggs" you will find listed in this
file:

1) Secret Key (a single keypress that results in some action, such as a
   message being displayed)
2) Password (a series of keypresses that result in some action)
3) Hidden message (a message embedded somewhere in a program or somewhere on
   a disk)
4) Game cheat (a sequence of keypresses that leads to some sort of game
   cheat)

I have even included some hardware Easter Eggs!  These are ones found in
certain pieces of Apple hardware that I have deemed significant.

An entry that has "(unverified)" next to the name of the ware indicates that
I have not been able to verify that entry, but am including it for you to
explore.  No claim is made as to the actual existence of an easter egg for
that particular entry.

Enjoy!

A) Press [ESC] at the main menu for a hidden page

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Airheart (Evil Sock's 16 sector crack; unverified)

A) Use a sector editor to view a message embedded on Track $00, Sector $2
B) Boot a DOS 3.3, insert your Airheart disk in the drive and then enter the
   following:

     CALL -151
     300: A9 00 8D EB B7 8D F0 B7 A9 21 8D EC B7 A9 0A 8D
     310: ED B7 A9 04 8D F1 B7 A9 01 8D F4 B7 20 E3 03 20
     320: D9 03 CE ED B7 EE F1 B7 AD F1 B7 C9 08 D0 ED 2C
     330: 00 C0 10 FB 2C 10 C0 A9 04 8D F1 B7 AD ED B7 C9
     340: 02 D0 D9 60
     300G

   This enters the monitor and creates a short program which loads some
   sectors off of the Airheart disk which contains a message from The Evil
   Sock.  I assume there is (or was) a way to load this message using a
   secret key but I was unable to figure it out.

(I tried contacting The Evil Sock to find out just how to access these
messages from a secret key.  No go.  I tore the game apart and looked for the
possible secret keys myself.  What I found instead were his routines to crash
the game if his text crack pages were changed in any way.  Neat, but no
secret keys to be found.)

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

----------
Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the

  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.
    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement

  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.

  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when

  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

----------
Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the

  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)

  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon

  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate

  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an

  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the

  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the

  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

     Greetings.  A lot of work went into this file.  I spent many long nights
tracking down these little gems that to this day still leave me smiling.
They are the last undiscovered relic of the Apple pirate world.  They remain
hidden on your disks, unknown, unrealized, waiting to be discovered, perhaps
finally now, perhaps never.  Never to be known by anyone except for the
person who planted it in the first place.  Call me weird, but there's a
certain mystique about them.  Its like finding an old coin buried in your
back yard:  it was there, waiting to be dug up,  and you didn't even realize
it.  Or finding that last easter egg (hence the name) on that certain Sunday
when you were but a little guy.  I am speaking of what I prefer to call
"secret keys".  I always got off on finding the things.  To think that years
ago, someone, somewhere, added something a little special to their work for
someone to find later is, well, real neat.

     This file is older than promises of an upgrade for the //gs...literally
(by the way, those of you still holding out hope, give it up).  I finally
felt it was time to put aside my perfectionist tendencies and put it out with
some incomplete or un-researched entries.  I used to tirelessly pursue every
lead I could in order to track down secret keys and the like; calling
different pirate friends around the country and asking them about ones I had
heard rumors of; searching disks sector by sector looking for funny or
interesting messages; boot tracing nearly every single one of my cracked
games to see if the title page routine included some check for a special
keypress.  I put a lot of time and effort into this file, and hope that the
few people who will take the time to read it will possibly gain some
enjoyment from checking out these gems for themselves.  This file was started
almost two years ago (I can't believe it myself).  If you're like me, you
still have most of these games or programs stuffed away in disk cases that
you rarely dig into anymore (mine make great dust collectors).  Now you have
a chance to re-live some of those fond memories of playing cool Apple games
well into the wee hours.  Perhaps not, but give it a whirl anyway, you might
enjoy some of the things you discover for the first time.

     A lot of these games are ancient (some a decade old!) and you probably
don't and won't ever have them.  I do have most of them (except for the GS
stuff...I don't have a GS and probably never will unless I can get one for
under $100...any offers?)  Of course, some of the more obscure hardware
easter eggs will be a challenge for those of you who will attempt to
experience every single secret key documented in this file.  As if anyone is
actually going to try, but if you are, try going to your school or some place
where they have old outdated Apple's.  You may even find some of the older
games still making the rounds in programming class when the twits should be
coding rather than playing Mario Bros.

     I had hoped to make this guide as complete and up-to-date as possible,
but considering its been aeons since I last touched it, I felt I may as well
release it now or never release it at all.  I don't know what kind of
audience this file will receive, but I hope the few people who do take the
time to get it are pleased with the effort I took to present them with these
gems and hope they enjoy them as much as I do.

     The Apple Pirate world was a killer playground for me: all the different
BBS' and the interesting types I met in different corners of the country.
The dead and lonely back-alley wares boards and the thriving elyte message
systems.  There will never be another community, another sub-society like it.
The 80's were a decade of advancement for all computers, but Apples and Apple
users led the way.  Apple users were the innovators, the originators.  The
pirate code of honor (and dishonor) that spawned from the Apple world, all
the words (K-K00L!), customs (crack screens and rag pages) found their way
into many different areas of the computer world as a whole.  Atari and
Commodore 64 groups hoped to only come close to the rich Apple pirate
traditions.  Oh, the bustling commerce of wares being traded between
different warehouse Meccas of pirated games!  But of course, all empires must
fall, or be absorbed into a greater whole.

     Near the end, other computers' pirating customs began spilling back
into the Apple realm, and it was completely lame.  But by then, the Apple
world was pretty much extinct anyway, only being carried on by those die-hard
romantics hoping to effect some sort of revival.  Now the Apple modem world
is but a ghost of what it once was.  Lonely, desolate, Apple BBS' are few and
far between.  I sometimes call out, now only to one and sometimes two Apple
BBS'.  The Apple may be dead, but then, so are a lot of other computers.  The
90s are here, man.  Things are changing real fast.  Apple and IBM working
together?  MicroSoft and IBM, splitsville?  Its so diverse out there now.
Don't hold back.  Use your Apple experience as a stepping stone onto other
platforms.  There's so much out there to try...

     Well, I got carried away, but since this is in all likelihood my last
major Apple world contribution, what the fuck.


                             :Acknowledgements:

Thanks to Hot Rod (where ever the hell he is these days) for publishing the
first secret key files and turning me on to this entertaining pastime and
for finding all the secret keys he did.  Also, thanks go to Apple Core for
the secret keys he found and published in his "Secret Game Keys" file.
Finally, thanks to the many people that informed me of new ones I hadn't
known about.  This file basically compiles all previously published secret
keys plus the few ones I have located into this one source guide.


These are the different types of "Easter Eggs" you will find listed in this
file:

1) Secret Key (a single keypress that results in some action, such as a
   message being displayed)
2) Password (a series of keypresses that result in some action)
3) Hidden message (a message embedded somewhere in a program or somewhere on
   a disk)
4) Game cheat (a sequence of keypresses that leads to some sort of game
   cheat)

I have even included some hardware Easter Eggs!  These are ones found in
certain pieces of Apple hardware that I have deemed significant.

An entry that has "(unverified)" next to the name of the ware indicates that
I have not been able to verify that entry, but am including it for you to
explore.  No claim is made as to the actual existence of an easter egg for
that particular entry.

Enjoy!

   This enters the monitor and creates a short program which loads some
   sectors off of the Airheart disk which contains a message from The Evil
   Sock.  I assume there is (or was) a way to load this message using a
   secret key but I was unable to figure it out.

(I tried contacting The Evil Sock to find out just how to access these
messages from a secret key.  No go.  I tore the game apart and looked for the
possible secret keys myself.  What I found instead were his routines to crash
the game if his text crack pages were changed in any way.  Neat, but no
secret keys to be found.)

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

----------
Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.
    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug

  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or

  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,

  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and

  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

Subject: Computer on 24hrs.day?

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

----------
Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an

  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

----------
Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the

  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the

  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.
  The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade

  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.

  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,

  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

----------
Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the

  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)

  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to

  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.
Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.

  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)

  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to

  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a

  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs

  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit

  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a

  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of

  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to

  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.

  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to

  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3

  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South

  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

----------
Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of

  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

  Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a

  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.
    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.

  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the

  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection

  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find

  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The

  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's

  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

----------
Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the

  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)

  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to

  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a

  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

Moderator's note: The following article is a lengthy excerpt from a
recent issue of FIDONEWS concerning individual privacy and the use of
aliases or handles in computer-based communications.  It was submitted by
a comp.society reader who used a handle; because the excerpt is a cross-
post from another electronic publication, I have taken the liberty of
viewing the use of a handle by sender as a request for privacy and
anonymity similar to the request a newspaper editor might receive in a
letter to the editor.  Thus, while reprinting the submission, the name
and address of the sender are "withheld upon request."  The article
raises a number of good points; the submission by a reader using a handle
to preserve anonymity makes a point; and the editorial action of
submitting the reader's posting anonymously makes the question current.
What are the implications of using aliases on the net?

We should never so entirely avoid danger as to appear
irresolute and cowardly.  But, at the same time, we should
avoid unnecessarily exposing ourselves to danger, than
which nothing can be more foolish.  [Cicero]

Do you trust me?

If you participate in computer conferencing, and you use
your real name, then you'd better.

"Why?", you ask.  "What can you do with my name?"  To start
with, given that and your origin line, I can probably look
you up in your local phone book, and find out where you
live.  Even if you are unlisted, there are ways to locate
you based on your name.  If you own any property, or pay any
utility bills, your address is a matter of public record.
Do you have children in the public schools?  It would be
easy to find out.  But that's just the beginning.

Former Chairman of the U.S. Privacy Protection Commission
David F. Linowes, in his book "Privacy in America" (1989),
writes of New York private investigator Irwin Blye:

    "Challenged to prove his contention that, given a little
    time and his usual fee, he could learn all about an
    individual without even speaking with him, Blye was
    presented with a subject -- a New Jersey
    newspaperman....  The result was a five-page, single-
    spaced, typed report which documented, though not always
    accurately, a wide sweep of the journalist's past, and
    was detailed to the point of disclosing his father's
    income before his retirement."

Who am I?  If I don't post, you might not even know I exist.
I could be on your local Police Department, or an agent
working with the IRS, or some federal law-enforcement
agency.  I could be a member of some fanatical hate group,
or criminal organization.  I might even be a former Nixon
White-House staffer!

I could be that pyromaniacal teenager you flamed last
weekend, for posting a step-by-step description of how he
made plastic explosive in his high-school chem lab.  He
seemed kind of mad.

But you're an upstanding citizen; you have nothing to hide.
So why not use your name on the nets?  Trust me.  There's
nothing to worry about.

Is there?

                  -------------------------

      Stupidity is evil waiting to happen.  [Clay Bond]


Not long ago in Fidonet's BCSNET echo (the Boston Computer
Society's national conference), the following was posted by
the conference moderator to a user calling himself "Captain
Kirk":

      "May we ask dear Captain Kirk that it would be very
      polite if you could use your real name in an echomail
      conference? This particular message area is shared
      with BBS's all across the country and everyone else is
      using their real name. It is only common courtesy to
      do so in an echomail conference."

One of us (mkj) responded with a post questioning that
policy.  Soon the conference had erupted into a heated
debate!  Although mkj had worried that the subject might be
dismissed as trivial, it apparently touched a nerve.  It
brought forth debate over issues and perceptions central to
computer communications in general, and it revealed profound
disparities in fundamental values and assumptions among
participants.

This article is a response to that debate, and to the
prevailing negative attitudes regarding the use of handles.
Handles seem to have a bad reputation.  Their use is
strangely unpopular, and frequently forbidden by network
authorities.  Many people seem to feel that handles are rude
or dishonest, or that anyone wishing to conceal his or her
identity must be up to no good.  It is the primary purpose
of this article to dispel such prejudices.

Let us make one thing perfectly clear here at the outset: We
do NOT challenge the need or the right of sysops to know the
identities of their users!  But we do believe that a sysop
who collects user names has a serious responsibility to
protect that information.  This means making sure that no
one has access to the data without a legal warrant, and it
certainly means not pressuring users to broadcast their real
names in widespread public forums such as conferences.

         John Lennon died for our sins.  [anonymous]


Andy Warhol said that "In the future, everyone will be
famous for fifteen minutes".  The computer nets, more than
any other medium, lend credibility to this prediction.  A
network conference may span the globe more completely than
even satellite TV, yet be open to anyone who can afford the
simplest computer and modem. Through our participation in
conferencing, each of us becomes, if only briefly, a public
figure of sorts -- often without realizing it, and without
any contemplation of the implications and possible
consequences.

Brian Reid (reid@decwrl.DEC.COM) conducts and distributes
periodic surveys of Usenet conference readership.  His
statistical results for the end of 1991 show that of the
1,459 conferences which currently make up Usenet, more than
fifty percent have over 20,000 readers apiece; the most
popular conferences are each seen by about 200,000 readers!
Mr. Reid's estimate of total Usenet readership is nearly TWO
MILLION people.

Note that Mr. Reid's numbers are for Usenet only; they do
not include any information on other large public nets such
as RIME (PC-Relaynet), Fido, or dozens of others, nor do
they take into account thousands of private networks which
may have indirect public network connections. The total
number of users with access to public networks is unknown,
but informed estimates range to the tens of millions, and
the number keeps growing at an amazing pace -- in fact, the
rate of growth of this medium may be greater than any other
communications medium in history.

The special problems and risks which arise when one deals
with a large public audience are something about which most
computer users have little or no experience or
understanding.  Until recently, those of us involved in
computer conferencing have comprised a small and rather
elite community.  The explosion in network participation is
catching us all a little unprepared.

Among media professionals and celebrities, on the other
hand, the risks of conducting one's business in front of a
public audience are all too familiar.  If the size of one's
audience becomes sufficiently large, one must assume that
examples of virtually every personality type will be
included: police and other agents of various governments,
terrorists, murderers, rapists, religious fanatics, the
mentally ill, robbers and con artists, et al ad infinitum.
It must also be assumed that almost anything you do, no
matter how innocuous, could inspire at least one person,
somewhere, to harbor ill will toward you.

The near-fatal stabbing of actress Theresa Saldana is a case
in point. As she was walking to her car one morning near her
West Hollywood apartment, a voice behind her asked, "Are you
Theresa Saldana?"; when she turned to answer, a man she had
never seen before pulled out a kitchen knife and stabbed her
repeatedly.

After her lengthy and painful recovery, she wrote a book on
the experience ("Beyond Survival", 1986).  In that book she
wrote:


     [pg 12]  "... Detective Kalas informed me that the
     assailant, whom he described as a Scottish drifter, had
     fixated upon me after seeing me in films."

     [pg 28]  "... it was through my work as an actress that
     the attacker had fixated on me.  Naturally, this made
     me consider getting out of show business ..."

     [pg 34]  "For security, I adopted an alias and became
     'Alicia Michaels.'  ... during the months that followed
     I grew so accustomed to it that, to this day, I still
     answer reflexively when someone calls the name Alicia!"

Or consider the fate of Denver radio talk show host Alan
Berg, who in 1984 died outside his home in a hail of
gunfire.  Police believe he was the victim of a local neo-
nazi group who didn't like his politics.

We are reminded of the murders of John Lennon and Rebecca
Shaffer; the Reagan/Hinckley/Foster incident; and a long
string of other "celebrity attacks" of all sorts, including
such bizarre events as the occupation of David Letterman's
home by a strange woman who claimed to be his wife! There is
probably no one in public life who doesn't receive at least
the occassional threatening letter.

Of course, ordinary participants in network conferencing may
never attract quite the attention that other types of
celebrities attract. But consider the following, rather less
apocalyptic scenarios:

    --  On Friday night you post a message to a public
        conference defending an unpopular or controversial
        viewpoint.  On Monday morning your biggest client
        cancels a major contract. Or you are kept up all
        night by repeated telephone calls from someone
        demanding that you "stop killing babies"!

    --  You buy your teenage son or daughter a computer and
        modem.  Sometime later you find your lawn littered
        with beer bottles and dug up with tire marks, or
        your home vandalized or burglarized.

    --  One day you are nominated to the Supreme Court.  Who
        are all these strange people on TV claiming to be
        your friends? How did that fellow know your position
        on abortion?  Your taste in GIFs?

Celebrities and other professional media personalities
accept the risks and sacrifices of notoriety, along with the
benefits, as part of their chosen careers.  Should computer
conference participants be expected to do the same?  And who
should be making these decisions?

  When thou art at Rome, do as they do at Rome  [Cervantes]


Older media seem to address the problems of privacy very
differently than computer media, at least so far.  We are
not aware of ANY medium or publication, apart from computer
conferencing, where amateur or even most professional
participants are required to expose their true names against
their will.  Even celebrities frequently use "stage names",
and protect their addresses and phone numbers as best they
can.

When a medium caters specifically to the general public,
participants are typically given even greater opportunities
to protect their privacy. Television talk shows have been
known to go so far as to employ silhouetting and electronic
alteration of voices to protect the identities of guests,
and audience members who participate are certainly not
required to state their full names before speaking.

The traditional medium most analogous to computer
conferencing may be talk radio.  Like conferencing, talk
radio is a group discussion and debate medium oriented
toward controversy, where emotions can run high. Programs
often center around a specific topic, and are always run by
a "host" whose role seems analogous in many respects to that
of a conference moderator.  It is therefore worth noting
that in talk radio generally, policy seems to be that
callers are identified on the air only by their first names
(unless of course they volunteer more).

Finally, of course, authors have published under "pen names"
since the dawn of publishing, and newspapers and magazines
frequently publish letters to the editor with "name and
address withheld by request" as the signature line. Even
founding fathers Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John
Jay, in authoring the seminal Federalist Papers in 1787 for
publication in the Letters columns of various New York City
newspapers, concealed their identities behind the now-famous
psuedonym "Publius".

What would you think if someone called a radio talk show
demanding to know the identity of a previous caller?  Such a
demand would undoubtedly be seen as menacing and
inappropriate in that context.  Yet that same demand seems
to arise without much challenge each time a handle shows up
in a computer conference.  The authors of this article feel
that such demands should always be looked upon as
suspicious, and that it would be beneficial for moderators
to take upon themselves the responsibility of making sure
that besieged handle-users are aware of their right to
refuse such inappropriate demands.

It is reasonable to assume that privacy policies in
traditional media are the result of hard-won wisdom gained
from long experience.  Are we so arrogant that we cannot
learn from others?  It is not hard to imagine the sorts of
problems and experiences which shaped these policies in the
old media.  Will we have to wait for similar problems to
occur on the computer networks before we learn?

                  PRIVACY AND SURVEILLANCE
                  ------------------------

        In an effort to identify people who fail to file tax
        returns, the Internal Revenue Service is matching
        its files against available lists of names and
        addresses of U.S. citizens who have purchased
        computers for home use. The IRS continues to seek
        out sources for such information. This information
        is matched against the IRS master file of taxpayers
        to see if those who have not filed can be
        identified.

        I just had an interesting visit from the FBI.  It
        seems that a posting I made to sci.space several
        months ago had filtered through channels, caused the
        FBI to open (or re-open) a file on me, and an agent
        wanted to interview me, which I did voluntarily...
        I then went on to tell him about the controversy
        over Uunet, and their role in supplying archives of
        Usenet traffic on tape to the FBI...

        Also frequent are instances where computers are
        seized incident to an unrelated arrest.  For
        example, on February 28, 1991, following an arrest
        on charges of rape and battery, the Massachusetts
        state and local police seized the suspect's computer
        equipment.  The suspect reportedly operated a 650-
        subscriber bulletin board called "BEN," which is
        described as "geared largely to a gay/leather/S&M
        crowd."  It is not clear what the board's seizure is
        supposed to have accomplished, but the board is now
        shut down, and the identities and messages of its
        users are in the hands of the police.

Most of us have been brought up to be grateful for the fact
that we live in a nation where freedom is sacred.  In other
countries, we are told as children, people are afraid to
speak their minds for fear they are being watched.  Thank
God we live in America!

It would surprise most of us to learn that America is
currently among the premiere surveillance nations in the
world, but such, sadly, is indeed the case.  Our leadership
in technology has helped the U.S. government to amass as
much information on its citizens as almost any other nation
in history, totalitarian or otherwise.  And to make matters
worse, a consumer surveillance behemoth has sprung up
consisting of huge private data-collection agencies which
cater to business.

As Evan Hendricks, editor of "Privacy Times" (a Washington
D.C.-based newsletter) has put it: "You go through life
dropping bits and pieces of information about yourself
everywhere.  Most people don't realize there are big vacuum
cleaners out there sucking it all up."  [Wall Street
Journal, March 14, 1991].

To get an idea of how much of your privacy has already been
lost, consider the bits and pieces of information about
yourself which are already available to investigators, and
how thoroughly someone might come to know you by these clues
alone.

A person's lifestyle and personality are largely described,
for example, by his or her purchases and expenses; from your
checking account records -- which banks are required by law
to keep and make available to government investigators -- a
substantial portrait of your life will emerge. Credit card
records may reveal much of the same information, and can
also be used to track your movements. (In a recent case,
"missing" Massachusetts State Representative Timothy O'Leary
was tracked by credit-card transactions as he fled across
the country, and his movements were reported on the nightly
news!)

Then there are your school records, which include IQ and
other test results, comments on your "socialization" by
teachers and others, and may reveal family finances in great
detail.  Employment and tax records reveal your present
income, as well as personal comments by employers and co-
workers.  Your properties are another public record of your
income and lifestyle, and possibly your social status as
well. Telephone billing records reveal your personal and
business associations in more detail. Insurance records
reveal personal and family health histories and treatments.

All of this information is commonly accessed by government
and private or corporate investigators.  And this list is
far from exhaustive!

Now consider how easily the computer networks lend
themselves to even further erosions of personal privacy. The
actual contents of our mail and telephone traffic have up to
now been subjected to deliberate scrutiny only under
extraordinary conditions. This built-in safety is due
primarily to the difficulty and expense of conducting
surveillance in these media, which usually requires extended
human intervention. But in the medium of computer
communications, most surveillance can be conducted using
automated monitoring techniques. Tools currently available
make it possible and even cost-effective for government and
other interests to monitor virtually everything which
happens here.

Why would anyone want to monitor network users?  It is well
documented that, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the FBI and
other agencies of government, in operations such as the
infamous COINTELPRO among others, spent a great deal of time
and effort collecting vast lists of names. As Computer
Underground Digest moderators Jim Thomas and Gordon Meyer
recalled in a recent commentary (CuD #3.42):

    "A 1977 class action suit against the Michigan State
    Police learned, through FOIA requests, that state and
    federal agents would peruse letters to the editor of
    newspapers and collect clippings of those whose politics
    they did not like. These news clippings became the basis
    of files on those persons that found there way into the
    hands of other agencies and employers."

To get onto one of these government "enemies" lists, you
often needed to do nothing more than telephone an
organization under surveillance, or subscribe to the "wrong"
types of magazines and newspapers. Groups engaged in
political activism, including environmental and women's
rights organizations, were commonly infiltrated.  The sort
of investigative reporting which uncovered these lists and
surveillances back in the '60s and '70s is now rare, but
there is little reason to assume that such activities have
ceased or even slowed.  In fact, progressive computerization
of local police LEIU activities (Law Enforcement
Intelligence Units, commonly known as "red squads") suggests
that such activities may have greatly increased.

Within the realm of computer conferencing especially, there
is ample reason to believe that systematic monitoring is
being conducted by government and law-enforcement
organizations, and perhaps by other hostile interests as
well.  In a recent issue of Telecom Digest
(comp.dcom.telecom), Craig Neidorf (knight@EFF.ORG) reported
on the results of a recent Freedom of Information Act
request for documents from the Secret Service:

    " ... The documents also show that the Secret Service
    established a computer database to keep track of
    suspected computer hackers.  This database contains
    records of names, aliases, addresses, phone numbers,
    known associates, a list of activities, and various
    [conference postings] associated with each individual."

But the privacy issues which surround computer
communications go far beyond the collection of user lists.
Both government and industry have long pursued the elusive
grail of personality profiling on citizens and consumers. Up
to now, such ambitions have been restrained by the practical
difficulty and expense of collecting and analyzing large
amounts of information on large numbers of citizens.  But
computer communications, more than any other technology,
seems to hold out the promise that this unholy grail may
finally be in sight.

To coin a phrase, never has so much been known by so few
about so many. The information commonly available to
government and industry investi-gators today is sufficient
to make reliable predictions about our personalities,
health, politics, future behavior, our vulnerabilities,
perhaps even about our innermost thoughts and feelings.  The
privacy we all take for granted is, in fact, largely an
illusion; it no longer exists in most walks of life.  If we
wish to preserve even the most basic minimum of personal
privacy, it seems clear that we need to take far better care
on the networks than we have taken elsewhere.

                           FREEDOM
                           -------

        Human beings are the only species with a history.
        Whether they also have a future is not so obvious.
        The answer will lie in the prospects for popular
        movements, with firm roots among all sectors of the
        population, dedicated to values that are suppressed
        or driven to the margins within the existing social
        and political order...
                                [Noam Chomsky]


In your day-to-day social interactions, as you deal with
employers, clients, public officials, friends, acquaintances
and total strangers, how often do you feel you can really
speak freely?  How comfortable are you discussing
controversial issues such as religion, taxes, politics,
racism, sexuality, abortion or AIDS, for example?  Would you
consider it appropriate or wise to express an honest opinion
on such an issue to your boss, or a client?  To your
neighbors?

Most of us confine such candid discussions to certain
"trusted" social contexts, such as when we are among our
closest friends.  But when you post to a network conference,
your boss, your clients, and your neighbors may very well
read what you post -- if they are not on the nets today,
they probably will be soon, as will nearly everyone.

If we have to consider each post's possible impact on our
social and professional reputations, on our job security and
income, on our family's acceptance and safety in the
community, it could be reckless indeed to express ourselves
freely on the nets.  Yet conferences are often geared to
controversy, and inhibitions on the free expression of
opinions can reduce traffic to a trickle, killing off an
important conference topic or distorting a valuable sampling
of public opinion.

More important still is the role computer networks are
beginning to play in the free and open dissemination of news
and information. Democracy is crippled if dissent and
diversity in the media are compromised; yet even here in the
U.S., where a "free press" is a cherished tradition, the
bulk of all the media is owned by a small (and ever-
shrinking) number of corporations, whose relatively narrow
culture, interests and perspec-tives largely shape the
public perception.

Computer communication, on the other hand, is by its nature
very difficult to control or shape.  Its resources are
scattered; when one BBS goes bust (or is busted!), three
others spring up in its place.  The natural resiliency of
computer communications (and other new, decentral-ized
information technologies such as fax, consumer camcorders
and cheap satellite links) is giving rise to a new brand of
global "guerrilla journalism" which includes everyone, and
defies efforts at suppression.

The power and value of this new journalistic freedom has
recently shown itself during the Gulf War, and throughout
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, as well as within the
U.S.  Just think of the depth and detail of information
available on the nets regarding the Secret Service's recent
"Operation Sundevil" and associated activities, compared to
the grossly distorted, blatantly propagandistic coverage of
those same activities given to the general public through
the traditional media.

Historically, established power and wealth have seldom been
disposed to tolerate uncontrolled media, and recent events
in this country and elsewhere show that computer media are
sometimes seen as threats to established interests as well.
To understand the role of handles in this context, it is
useful to note the flurries of anti-handle sentiment which
have arisen in the wake of crackdowns such as Sundevil, or
the Tom Tcimpidis raid in the early 1980s.  Although few
charges and fewer convictions have typically resulted from
such operations, one might be tempted to speculate that the
real purposes -- to terrorize the nets and chill freedoms of
speech and assembly thereon -- have been achieved.

In this way, sysops and moderators become unwitting
accomplices in the supression of freedom on the networks.
When real name requirements are instituted, anyone who fears
retaliation of any sort, by any group, will have to fear
participation in the nets; hence content is effectively
controlled.  This consideration becomes especially important
as the nets expand into even more violent and repressive
countries outside the U.S.

We must decide whether freedom of information and open
public discussion are in fact among the goals of network
conferencing, and if so, whether handles have a role in
achieving these goals.  As access to the networks grows, we
have a rare opportunity to frustrate the efforts of
governments and corporations to control the public mind!  In
this way above all others, computers may have the potential
to shape the future of all mankind for the better.

                      A CALL TO ACTION
                      ----------------


       The move to electronic communication may be a turning
       point that history will remember.  Just as in
       seventeenth and eighteenth century Great Britain and
       America a few tracts and acts set precedents for
       print by which we live today, so what we think and do
       today may frame the information system for a
       substantial period in the future.
        [Ithiel de Sola Pool, "Technologies of Freedom", 1983]


There was a time when anybody with some gear and a few
batteries could become a radio broadcaster -- no license
required.  There was a time when anyone with a sense of
adventure could buy a plane, and maybe get a contract to
carry mail.  Those early technological pioneers were
probably unable to imagine the world as it is today, but
their influence is strongly felt in current laws,
regulations and policies with roots in the traditions and
philosophies they founded and shaped.

Today the new pioneers are knitting the world together with
computers, and the world is changing faster than ever.  Law
and ethics are scrambling to keep up.  How far will this
growth take us?  No one can say for sure.  But you don't
need a crystal ball to see that computer communications has
the potential to encompass and surpass all the functionality
of prior media -- print, post, telegraph, telephone, radio
and television -- and more.  It seems reasonable to assume
that computer communications will be at least as ubiquitous
and important in the lives of our grandchildren as all the
older media have been in ours.

It will be a world whose outlines we can now make out only
dimly.  But the foundations of that world are being built
today by those of us exploring and homesteading on the
electronic frontier.  We need to look hard at what it will
take to survive in the information age.

In this article we have attempted to show, for one very
narrow issue, what some of the stakes may be in this future-
building game.  But the risks associated with exposing your
name in a computer conference are not well defined, and
various people will no doubt assess the importance of these
risks differently.  After all, most of us take risks every
day which are probably greater than the risks associated
with conferencing. We drive on the expressway.  We eat
sushi.  To some people, the risks of conferencing may seem
terrifying; to others, insignificant.

But let us not get side-tracked into unresolvable arguments
on the matter.  The real issue here is not how dangerous
conferencing may or may not be; it is whether you and I will
be able to make our own decisions, and protect ourselves (or
not) as we see fit.  The obvious answer is that users must
exercise their collective power to advance their own
interests, and to pressure sysops and moderators to become
more sensitive to user concerns.

To help in that effort, we would like to recommend the
following guidelines for user action:

    --  Bear in mind John Perry Barlow's observation that
        "Liberties are preserved by using them".  Let your
        sysop know that you would prefer to be using a
        handle, and use one wherever you can.

    --  Try to support boards and conferences which allow
        handles, and avoid those which don't.

    --  When using a handle, BEHAVE RESPONSIBLY!  There will
        always be irresponsible users on the nets, and they
        will always use handles.  It is important for the
        rest of us to fight common anti-handle prejudices by
        showing that handles are NOT always the mark of an
        irresponsible user!

    --  Educate others about the importance of handles (but
        NEVER argue or flame anyone about it).

To sysops and moderators: We ask you to bear in mind that
authority is often used best where it is used least.  Grant
users the right to engage in any harmless and responsible
behaviors they choose.  Protect your interests in ways which
tread as lightly as possible upon the interests of others.
The liberties you preserve may be your own!

In building the computer forums of today, we are building
the social fabric of tomorrow.  If we wish to preserve the
free and open atmosphere which has made computer networking
a powerful force, while at the same time taking care against
the risks inherent in such a force, handles seem to be a
remarkably harmless, entertaining and effective tool to help
us.  Let's not throw that tool away.

AN INTERESTING MESSAGE POSTED ON TEXCON
CAUGHT MY EYE..IN LIGHT OF THE NAZI BBS
THE MOLESTERS BBS AND THE BUST IN N.J..
A NEW FEDERAL LAW THAT WOULD OUTLAW OR
SEVERELY RESTRICT BBS ACTIVITY IS BEING
PUSHED THROUGH CONGRESS, ACCORDING TO 
TWO SOURCES THE METAL DETECTOR AND JOHN
EDENS. ANOMG THE RESTRICTIONS DISCUSSED
ARE: *REGISTRATION OF ALL BBS AS PUBLIC
      UTILITIES.
     *SYSOPS REQUIRED TO KEEP LOGS OF 
      ALL USERS "VERIFIED" NAMES AND
      ADDRESSES.
     *SYSOPS REQUIRED TO KEEP LOGS OF
      ALL MESSAGE POSTINGS AND TIMES OF
      POSITNG
     *CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR SYSOPS WHO
      ALLOW ILLEGAL MESSAGE POSTINGS
      WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE KNOW OF
      THE CONTENT OR HAVE HAD A CHANCE
      TO REMOVE IT.
     *BBS USERS WOULD BE "REQUIRED" TO
      USE THEIR LEGAL NAMES.
I HAVE NO WAY TO BE SURE THIS DATA IS 
CORRECT, BUT I SUSPECT IT IS CLOSE TO 
THE TRUTH. CONTACT YOUR CONGRESSIONAL
REPRESENTATIVE, THEY ALMOST ALL HAVE 
800 #'S, AND FIND OUT AND EXPRESS YOUR
OPINION, TOO, WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE

THE WARLOCK LORD
WHEW-

WHAT A YEAR SO FAR-
BOARDS BEING BUSTED THROUGHOUT THE U.S.
NEW COMPUTER CRIME LAWS BEING ABUSED BY
COPS IN MOST STATES (THOUGH MOST OF THESE LAWS CERTAINLY WILL PROVE
UN-CONSTITUTIONAL IF EVER TAKEN TO THE SUPREME COURT).
AND-NEW FEDERAL LAWS IN THE FEDERAL SUB-COMMITTEES WAITIN TO BE VOTED ON!
ALSO,YE SECRET SERVICE HAS TAKEN OVER
FEDERAL COMPUTER INVESTIGATIONS FROM
THE FBI.

SEEMS LIKE EVERY PREDICTION I MADE IN
EARLIER ISSUES HAS COME TRUE!

NOW LET ME TELL YA WHATS HAPPENIN AND
WHY. THE FEDS KNOW EVERYTHING IS GOIN
COMPUTER IN THE NEAR FUTURE,AND NATURALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCYS WANTED THE
WORST LAWS POSSIBLE ON THE BOOKS SO
THEY COULD RUN AMOK WITHOUT ANY CONCERN
OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.
SINCE OUR LEGISLATORS KNOW LITTLE OF
COMPUTER HAPPENINGS,YE SNEAKY FEDS 
DECIDED TO RAID VIRTUALLY EVERY KID
THAT RAN A GOOD BOARD THIS SPRING.
NATURALLY,THEY SPENT MEGA-THOUSANDS
ON THESE RAIDS AND THEN WERE KIND
ENOUGH TO MIS-INFORM THE PRESS AS
TO FABLES LIKE HACKERS MOVIN SATELITES,
ETC.NOW WHEN OUR INK HUNGRY MEDIA GOT
HOLD OF ALL THESE LIES, THEY TRUMP
EM UP EVEN FURTHER IN A BLITZ THAT
INCLUDED FRONT PAGE HEADLINES,UPI,
AND NATIONAL TV.
 O.K. SO HERE SITS MR & MRS CITIZEN
BELIEVIN THAT GARBAGE AN CALLIN MR
CONGRESSMAN SCREAMIN BLOODY MURDER.
 AN YA CAN GUESS WHATS HAPPENIN NOW-
YEP-THEYRE TRYIN TO DEPRIVE US OF
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS (1ST & 4TH
AMMENDMENTS) THROUGH NEW PENDING
LEGISLATION......

NOW YA SAY-WHAT CAN BE DONE?

OK-WRITE EVERY CONGRESSMAN IN YOUR
STATE AND ALSO OTHER STATES AN EVEN
THE PRESIDENT TELLIN THEM YOU DONT
WANT ANY LAWS PASSED THAT WILL
INFRINGE ON YOUR RIGHTS RE COMPUTERS.
MASS PRODUCE THOSE LETTERS & SEND EM
OUT NOW-THESE BAD LAWS CAN ONLY BE
STOPPED BY DOIN SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY.

ALSO-BITCH ABOUT SPENDING ALL OUR
TAX MONEY HARASSING KIDS.THERE IS
A LOT OF CROOKS RUNNIN ROUND THEY
SHOULD BE AFTER WITH THOSE FEDERAL
AGENTS.

AND MAKE UP PETITIONS SIGNED BY 
ANYONE FROM ADULTS TO YOUR CLASSMATES
TO SEND IN ALSO. HECK-SEND THOSE
LETTERS IN EVERY WEEK TILL WE GET

IT SEEMS THERE'S A DEMAND FOR A W/P
SWITCH ON THE ANDROMEDA -- SO HERE IT
IS ...
 
 LOCATED ON THE ANDROMEDA RAM CARD IS
 A PIN NUMBER 25 WHICH HAPPENS TO BE 
 THE POWER (+5V) PIN. IF THIS PIN IS
 FOLLOWED ONTO THE PC BOARD, THERE WILL
 BE TWO RESISTORS (SMALL TUBE-LIKE 
THINGS WITH COLOR BANDS AND ONE LEAD
OUT OF EACH END). AT ONE END THE POWER
WILL GO INTO THIS RESISTOR, AT THE OTHE
R ANOTHER TRACE WILL GO OFF TO SOME
OF THE OTHER ELECTRONICS ON THE BOARD.
WE WANT TO USE THE END THAT HAS THE
TRACES GOING TO OTHER CHIPS ON THE 
BOARD. (CALL THIS POINT #1 (USE EITHER
RESISTOR - THERE ARE TWO)). POINT NUMBE
R TWO IS WHERE PIN 18 FROM THE APPLE
CONNECTOR (7 PINS DOWN FROM 25 ON THE
SAME SIDE) ENTERS ONTO THE PC BOARD
AND IMMEDIATELY GOES THROUGH TO THE
OTHER SIDE (AFTER ABT 1/2 "). THIS
IS POINT #2.  IF YOU TRACE WHERE TH
E THING COMES OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE, 
YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT IT POPS BACK ON
THE SIDE IT STARTED FROM ABOUT 1/2" 
LATER... THIS LITTLE LINK IS WHEERE WE
CUT THE TRACE TO INSERT THE SWITCH.
OK, WE CUT THE TRACE BETWEEN THE TWO
POINTS THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE PC
BOARD. LABEL THE OTHER PLACE WHERE THE
TRACE GOES THROUGH POINT#3.  NOW WE
WILL ATTACH AN SPDT SWITCH TO THE BOARD
 SOLDER ONE WIRE TO POINT 3, AND ATTACH
IT TO THE CENTER TERMINAL OF THE SWITCH
THEN SOLDER A WIRE TO POINT 1 AND 
ATTACH IT TO EITHER SIDE OF THE CENTER
SWITCH. LASTLY, TAKE A WIRE AND SOLDER
IT TO POINT 2 AND THEN TO THE UNUSED
PIN ON THE SWITCH. THERE YOU HAVE IT!
WHEN THE SWITCH HANDLE IS ON THE SAME
SIDE AS THE WIRE FROM POINT #1, REG-
ULAR OPERATION WILL TAKE PLACE. IF THE
SWITCH IS THROWN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
THE CARD WILL BE WRITE PROTECTED.

        DOS Notes & Pointers..
        ======================

        -=> By THE FREEZE <=-

Suggested reading: Beneath Apple DOS
                   The DOS Manual

Needed equipment: Apple, Drive
                  IQ > 60

  I will start this article by giving
you an overview of what is in DOS and
what it does. First of all there is
the RWTS. This allows you to read or
write a sector at a time. All oper-
ations are done either directly or
indirectly through this. Starting at
$B600 and ending at $BFFF RWTS takes
up about 2.5K. Next is the File
Manager. This goes from $AAC9 to $B5FF
This is a bunch of subroutines which
execute your commands from basic.
Then there are the main DOS routines.
These interpret your commands and tell
the file manager what to do, which in
turn uses the RWTS to do them. These
routines go from $9D00 to $AAC8.
When you have MAXFILES set to 3, DOS
reserves memory from $9600 to $9CFF.
Setting MAXFILES higher will take up
more memory, lower than $9600.
There is another part of DOS, which
resides in the latter part of page 3
or from $3D0 to $3FF. This is called
the Dos Vector Table. I will go into
detail on that later.

 Well now, lets say you put a disk in
the drive and turned your computer on.
Then you loaded a file, edited it and
saved it. Why don't we take a look and
see exactly what is happening.

 When you turn your computer on (if
you have autostart) the code on your
drive controller prom takes over.
This loads in a routine at $800.
This is called Boot 0. Then it jumps
to $801 and executes that code (boot
1). That code loads in sectors 1
through 9 which in turn loads in the
rest of DOS. Then it looks to see if
you have a HELLO program and jumps
to it. The first thing it does when
loading in a program, in this case
the HELLO program, is look at the
catalog track. Then after it finds
the file and the track and sector it
starts on, it reads in the first
sector. The first sector of a program
is called the Track Sector List or
TSL. This is a listing of all tracks
and sectors that have data for that
program. DOS reads this into memory
and then starts loading the program
in. But where does it know where to
load the program in and how does it
know what file type it is?
The file type was back on the catalog,
more (lots more) on that later...
On the first sector of data, not the
TSL, in the first two bytes is the
address to start loading in at. These
bytes as usual are in reverse order.
Well, now you know a little of how
DOS works. Lets go into more detail.

 Here is where I will probably lose
you. If it gets confusing hang on.
 Now we will look at track $11, which
is the catalog track. The VTOC or
Volume Table Of Contents is stored
at track $11, sector $00. This tells
DOS such things as: what sectors are
free, volume #, DOS version, first
link to catalog sector...
Bytes $01 & $02 of the VTOC tells us
 where to find the
first catalog sector. This usually is
track $11, sector $0F. Byte $02 is
the DOS version. Either a "1", "2",
"3", for DOS 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, consec-
utively. Byte $07 is the volume #
usually $FE (254). The next thing of
interest is the Bit Map. Starting at
byte $38 you will see "FFFF0000".
For now, ignore the last two bytes.
The "FFFF" is a binary representation
of what sectors are free on a certain
track. In the two bytes there are
16 bits. Makes sense doesn't it, 16
bits and 16 sectors. If the bit is
set or a "1" then that sector is free.
If it is a "0" then it's used.
Now lets look at the catalog link.
On track $11, sector $0F, byte $01,
are two bytes that tell what track
and sector to find the first catalog
sector. This is almost always track 11
sector $0F. On track $11, sector $0F,
bytes 1 and 2, is a pointer to the
next sector, track $11, sector $0E.
The links continue until sector $01
where you will see zero's in those
bytes. I have been asked many times
how to get more than 105 files onto
a disk. If you edit the second and
third bytes on track $11, sector $01
to "100F", you will be able to use
track $10, sector $0F for a catalog
sector. You can continue on track
10 sector F and make a link to the
next sector and so on. Be sure to
mark it on the bit map or it will
get wiped out when DOS has to write
there. Well, we have covered most
of the VTOC, lets look at how the
catalog sectors are formatted.

 Starting at byte $0B on any catalog
sector, is the entry for a file.
The first two bytes after that, tells
what track and sector the program
starts on. Then is the file type (more
on that later). Next comes the file
name, up to 30 characters. The last
byte before the next entry tells us
how many sectors the file takes.
This usually never goes over 255
sectors, however text files can take
more than 255 sectors. Now we can
look at the file type. We have to look
at this at the binary level. If the
first bit is set, it is a text file.
If the second is set, it's Integer.
Third is applesoft, fourth is binary.
If the eigth or MSB is set, the file
is locked. It's really quite simple.
$00 means a text file. $80 means a
locked text file. If it is a $84,
we have a locked binary file.

 Now for the complicated stuff, how
DOS writes sectors, INITs a disk,
the "6 & 2" split. Lets say you put a
blank disk in the drive, initialized
it, and saved a file onto it. Lets see
what happens. First off, at $A54F is
the INIT routine. If you did A54FG
from monitor, it would INIT your disk
without a hello program. This lets
your disk boot faster because it does
not have to load in that file.
Ok. So you type in "INIT HELLO". DOS
takes over and starts formatting your
disk starting with track 0 and ending
with track $23. Then it writes the
catalog track and VTOC. Last it writes
in DOS. Lets take a close look at a
disk at the track level. First off we
have what is called a GAP. This is made
up of "FF"'s. Then we have the prolouge
marks, ye olde "D5 AA 96". After that
comes the volume, track, sector, check-
sum, epilouge "DE AA EB". Then comes a
smaller GAP with a different prolouge
"D5 AA AD". Then $342 bytes of user
data. Oops! $342 bytes of user data?
I thought there were only $FF or 255
bytes per sector! (more on this later).
Then we have the checksum. And last
we have the epilouge "DE AA EB".
There are certain bytes that DOS
doesn't write as data. These bytes are
used in proulouge and epilouge marks.
DOS looks for these when trying to find
a sector. Now for the "6 & 2" split.
The hardware on the apple doesn't allow
for more than $3F different bytes to
be written. That's why they used the
"5 & 3" split on 3.2 disks. What that
means is that from one byte, five bits
are taken out and form one byte. The
other three bits form one byte also.
The six and two split is the same thing
as the five and three but allows for
more combinations.

 Now for a little on copy protection.
Back in the good 'ol days we could just
demuffin everything. All they had was
a modified DOS or changed address marks
etc. After that they got a little
smarter and some wrote their own DOS
or used a modified RWTS. But nothing
stops us pirates, all you had to do
is read in data through their RWTS and
write it back out standard. Then they
got dirty, using the text page and the
input buffer for data or code. They
even used the stack (page 1) for code.
To get around this, NMI card like
crackshot and cracking chips were made.
these dumped all memory to disk allow-
ing the text page and the input buffer
to be undisturbed. The newest thing
seems to be SPIRAL TRACKING. The first
game I saw this on was Maze Craze.
Cracking it was quite easy though. All
you had to do is cut out one part of
disk access (at $855) that wasn't even
needed. But who knows what we will be
up against in the future.

 I suggest you read "Beneath Apple DOS"
 and look at the DOS manual supplied
with your Apple. This is for beginners
or people who are too lazy to read
a book...

 I would appreciate lots of questions,
I may not have made myself too clear
or you may want to know more about
a certain area. Just leave me e-mail.

   The Freeze

       D O S     T R I C K S        
 
 TRY THIS TO SEE ANY DOS, REMOVE THE
REAR MOST SET OF RAM CHIPS FROM YOUR
APPLE (THE ONES NEAR THE I/O SLOTS).
THEN INIT A DISK, REPLACE THE RAM AND
BOOT UP UNDER THE PROGRAM YOU WISH TO
DEPROTECT. THEN FORCE A REBOOT WITH THE
DISK YOU INITED IN DRIVE 1. THE DOS 
FROM THE PROTECTED DISK WILL (IN MOST
CASES) STILL BE IN THE RAM UP TOP....
 
THIS NEW DOS IS A SLAVE AT 32 K AND
THE OLD (AND PROTECTED DOS) IS STILL
AT 48 K. THIS WILL WORK ON ABOUT 50%
OF THE PROGRAMS.  ENJOY
 

YOU CAN ALSO REMOVE THE TOP 32K AND
GET TWICE AS MUCH.

=======================================
CHECKSUM TRICK

A  VERY  HANDY TECHNIQUE FOR  TAKING  A
LOOK AT THE DATA ON A PROTECTED DISK IS
TO  DISABLE  THE CHECKSUM IN THE  RWTS.
THE  FORMATS  OF MANY  PROTECTED  DISKS
VARY ONLY IN THIS CHECKSUM,  SO TURNING
IT   OFF  SHOULD  ALLOW  ANY   STANDARD
TRACK/SECTOR  UTILITY  TO LOOK  AT  THE
DISK!  TO DO THIS, BOOT UP THE DOS THAT
YOU WISH TO USE, AND ENTER THE MONITOR.
THEN  ENTER   B942:18 FOR  DOS  3.3  OR
B963:18  FOR DOS 3.2.   THIS CHANGES  A
SET  CARRY INSTRUCTION TO A CLEAR CARRY
INSTRUCTION.  NOW RETURN TO DOS AND RUN
YOUR  EDITOR.   IF  THE  DISK  YOU  ARE
LOOKING  AT  IS  PROTECTED  WITH   THIS
SYSTEM,  YOU  SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ IT
NOW. TO MAKE  THIS CHANGE TO A DOS ON A
DISK, THIS DATA IS CONTAINED IN TRACK 0
SECTOR  3,  AT EITHER BYTE $42 OR  BYTE
$63, FOR DOS 3.3 OR 3.2, RESPECTIVELY.
GOOD LUCK.......
                     RANDY

=======================================

TO AVOID RE-LOADING THE LANGUAGE CARD
ON BOOTUP ( A MAJOR IRRITATION )
CHANGE THE FOLLOWING :
 
 
IN A 48K SYSTEM, CHANGE $BFCC TO 00 AND
$BFCF TO 00 : THIS WILL PREVENT THE 
LANGUAGE CARD FROM BEING WRITTEN TO.
(INITIALIZE A DISKETTE WITH THIS DO
 TO MAKE IT BOOT UP IN THIS FASHION)
 
(IF YOU LOOK AT THE CODE, YOU CAN MAKE 
THE SAME MODS IN A COPY OF A SYST
MASTER ON THE DISK ITSELF, SO A MASTER
CREATE WILL PUT THIS DOS ON A DISKETTE.
CHANGE THE CODE THAT SAYS LDA C081 WITH
LDA C000 -- THAT SSHOULD WORK FINE.
 
=======================================

GET INTO MONITOR FROM A NORMAL DISK.
TYPE:   400<A800.ABFFM
 
POOF THERE YOU HAVE ALL THE DOS COMANDS
NOTICE THAT ALL THE LETTERS IN THE
COMAND ARE FLASHING BUT THE LAST ONE
THAT IS TO TELL YOU WHERE THE COMAND
ENDS. NOW NOTICE WHERE THE INIT,LOAD,
BLOAD,SAVE,BSAVE,CATALOG, ETC...
THEN BOOT SOMETHING LIKE BRAIN SURGEON
OR SOMETHING THAT HAS SOMETHING LIKE
A NORMAL FORMAT THEN TYPE THAT LINE
AND THEN YOU CAN SEE IF THEY CHANGED
ANY OF THE COMANDS!

COSMOS PROVIDES A LANGUAGE BY MEAN OF 
WHICH A USER CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE 
SYSTEM. THE LANGUAGE INCLUDES VARIOUS
PREFIXES AS WELL AS INPUT FORMATS AND

MSG LEFT BY: SALLY RIDE
DATE POSTED: 

INPUT VALUES. PREFIXES ARE ABBREVIATION
WHICH REPRESENT SPECIFIC DATA CATAGORIE
TO THE SYSTEM WHEN INPUT BY THE USER. 
AN EXAMPLE OF A PREFIX IS "TN"WHICH 
MEANS "TELEPHONE NUMBER". AN INPUT 
FORMAT DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF CHARAC-
TERS FOLLOWING A PREFIX AS WELL AS THE
PATTERN IN WHICH THESE MUST BE ENTERED.
FOR EXAMPLE, "TN XXX-XXXX" MEANS THAT 
THE PREFIX "TN" MUST BE FOLLOWED BY 
SEVEN CHARACTERS IN THE FORMAT SHOWN.
 
INPUT VALUES ARE THE ALLOWABLE DATA
ENTERED FOR EACH PREFIX IN THE CORRECT
INPUT FORMAT. AS MENTIONED IN THE 
PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH THE INPUT FORMAT
FOR THE PREFIX "TN" IS "TN XXX-XXXX"
THE FIRST THREE CHARACTERS (XXX) MUST
BE ALPHANUMERIC; THE LAST FOUR (XXXX)
MUST BE NUMERIC. SO, COSMOS WOULD CON-
SIDER AN INPUT OF "TN 935-2481" AS
VALID INPUT. BUT YOU *MUST* USE THE
CORRECT WIRE CENTER FOR THE (XXX) IN 
QUESTION. IN HACKING COSMOS PART 2
LEX WILL HAVE A LIST OF THE MOST 
COMMONLY USED PREFIXES, FORMATS AND
PREFIX CODE VALUES WHICH ENABLE YOU
TO READ AND UNDERSTAND COSMOS TRANS-
ACTIONS.

             STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO BACKING-UP DISKS
                              WITH
                         NIBBLES AWAY ][

     THERE ARE THREE BASIC STEPS TO BACKUP A DISKETTE:

1. LOCATE THE TRACKS WHICH CONTAIN DATA.
2. FIND THE ADDRESS MARKER FOR THE SECTORS THERE.
3. FIGURE OUT ANY ADDITIONAL PROTECTION.

(HINT: #3 IS THE HARD ONE!)

     FOR  MOST  OF  THE PROCEDURES BELOW,  A BASIC WORKING  KNOWLEDGE  OF  THE
TRACK/BIT EDITOR (TBE) IS REQUIRED.   FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH  THE
TBE,  AN OVERALL DESCRIPTION AND SOME EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN BELOW.   THE EXAMPLES
ARE  EASIER TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY ARE PERFORMED AS YOU READ THIS,  SO YOU  MAY
WANT TO BOOT UP NIBBLES AWAY ][ AND TRY THEM OUT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT IS GOING ON.

     ENTER  THE  TBE  BY SELECTING OPTION 'T' FROM THE  MAIN  MENU.   A  LARGE
SECTION  OF  NUMBERS WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN,  WITH TWO DASHED LINES AT  THE
TOP.   THE  INFORMATION IN BETWEEN THESE LINES IS THE STATUS  INFORMATION  AND
INFORMS YOU OF SUCH THINGS AS CURSOR POSITION,  TRACK NUMBER,  AND IS ALSO THE
LOCATION  WHERE VARIOUS PROMPTS APPEAR FOR CERTAIN FUNCTIONS.   THE NUMBERS AT
THE  BOTTOM  ARE SEPARATED INTO TWO SECTIONS.   ON THE LEFT ARE  THE  STARTING
MEMORY  ADDRESS'S FOR EACH LINE TO THE RIGHT.   MOVE THE CURSOR  AROUND  USING
I,J,K OR M, AND WATCH THE ADDR INDICATOR IN THE STATUS LINE.  IT WILL TELL YOU
EXACTLY WHAT MEMORY ADDRESS THE VALUE UNDER THE CURSOR REPRESENTS.   THE ARROW
KEYS  CHANGE THE AREA OF MEMORY WHICH YOU CAN SEE.   THEY SHIFT YOUR VIEW  256
BYTES FORWARD OR BACKWARD AT A TIME.   THE ONLY REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW
FOR  THIS DISCUSSION IS HOW TO USE THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE THE VIEWING 'WINDOW'
AROUND IN MEMORY.
     THE  ';'  (UNSHIFTED '+') AND THE '-' KEYS INCREMENT  AND  DECREMENT  THE
TRACK  NUMBER IN THE STATUS LINE.   PRESSING 'R' WILL CAUSE DRIVE ONE TO  READ
THE  DATA FROM THE TRACK INDICATED IN THE STATUS LINE INTO MEMORY.   THE BYTES
ON THE SCREEN WILL CHANGE,  SINCE DIFFERENT DATA HAS BEEN READ  IN.   PRESSING
THE  'R'  KEY  MULTIPLE TIMES WILL RESULT IN DIFFERENT DATA  BEING  DISPLAYED.
THIS IS BECAUSE NIBBLES AWAY ][ STARTS READING AT WHATEVER POINT HAPPENS TO BE
UNDER THE HEAD WHEN THE DRIVE IS TURNED ON,  WHICH IS RANDOM, HENCE THE CHANGE
IN  THE  DISPLAYED DATA (THE DATA IS NOT ACTUALLY DIFFERENT,  IT IS  JUST  NOT
LOADED AT THE SAME MEMORY LOCATION AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY).

STEP 1:
     TO  DO  THIS WE MUST LOCATE ALL OF THE TRACKS ON THE DISK  WHICH  CONTAIN
DATA.   TO DO THIS WE SHOULD HAVE THE TRACK POINTER SET TO TRACK 00.  PRESSING
'R'  WILL READ IN THE TRACK AND SHOW IT ON THE SCREEN.   THE ARROW KEYS SHOULD
BE  USED  TO MOVE THE VIEWING 'WINDOW' TO START AT $2000.   NOW WE  WILL  MOVE
FORWARD  AND TRY TO DETERMINE IF THIS TRACK CONTAINS  VALID  DATA.   ACTUALLY,
TRACK 00 MUST CONTAIN SOME DATA IN ORDER FOR THE DISK TO BOOT,  BUT WE WILL BE
USING THIS PROCEDURE ON OTHER TRACKS WHICH DO NOT NECESSARILY CONTAIN DATA.
     THE  MAIN  THING  WHICH WILL IDENTIFY A TRACK AS CONTAINING DATA  IS  THE
PRESENCE OF GAPS.   GAPS ARE SECTIONS OF THE SAME BYTE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES.
NORMALLY THEY ARE MADE UP OF $FF'S AND ARE 6-20 IN LENGTH.   TO SEE WHAT THESE
LOOK  LIKE,  INSERT YOUR SYSTEM MASTER DISK AND READ IN TRACK 00 AS  DESCRIBED
ABOVE.   MOVING  THROUGH  THE BUFFER WITH THE ARROW KEYS WILL REVEAL  A  LARGE
VARIETY  OF VALUES.   SPACED OUT AMONG THESE SHOULD BE SECTIONS OF FF'S  WHICH
CONTAIN ABOUT 6-20 IN A ROW,  DEPENDING ON THE EXACT DISK.   NORMALLY DOS  3.2
DISKS HAVE LARGER GAPS THAN DOS 3.3 DISKS.  THERE SHOULD BE MANY OCCURANCES OF
THE  GAPS,  SPACED OUT SO THAT YOU SEE ONE ABOUT EVERY OTHER TIME THAT YOU USE
THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE FORWARD OR BACKWARD.

NOTE:YOU  MAY SEE A SECOND,  SMALLER (2-5 $FF'S),  GAP FOLLOWING A LARGE  GAP,
     WITH  A SMALL SECTION OF DATA IN BETWEEN.   THIS IS CALLED THE  SECONDARY
     GAP.   WHEN  REFERING TO A GAP HERE,  WE WILL ALWAYS BE TALKING ABOUT THE
     PRIMARY GAP, NOT THE SECONDARY ONE.

     NOW TRY LOOKING AT OTHER TRACKS ON THE DISK.  FIRST LOOK ONLY AT THE FULL
TRACKS  (NO .5 ON THE END).   ALL OF THEM WILL BE SIMILAR TO TRACK 00  IN  THE
APPEARANCE  OF  THE GAPS.   YOU MAY WANT TO TRY THIS SEVERAL TIMES  TO  BECOME
COMFORTABLE WITH LOCATING GAPS ON A GIVEN TRACK.
     NOW READ IN A HALF TRACK (.5 ON THE END).   SCAN MEMORY TO LACATE SOME OF
THE GAPS.  SINCE SYSTEM MASTER DISKS DO NOT USE HALF-TRACKS, THE DATA WHICH WE
SEE HERE IS REALLY 'CROSS-TALK'.  IN OTHER WORDS, DATA WAS WRITTEN ON THE FULL
TRACK,  BUT  THE  MAGNETIC PATTERN SPREAD OUT A BIT,  AND SO WE SEE SOME  DATA
HERE.   THE TELL-TALE SIGN OF THIS PHENOMENA IS THAT THE GAPS WILL NOT BE  ALL
THE  SAME.   THAT IS,  THEY MAY HAVE ONE OR MORE VALUES IN THEM WHICH ARE  NOT
CONSISTENT.   THIS TELLS US THAT THERE IS SOME DATA ON THIS TRACK, BUT THAT IT
IS NOT VALID DATA.  TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OTHER HALF-TRACKS SO THAT YOU CAN TELL
IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT A FULL TRACK OR A HALF TRACK BY EXAMINING THE GAPS.
     THE NEXT ITEM WHICH YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IS A BLANK TRACK.  TO
DO THIS, INSERT A BLANK (NON-INITIALIZED) DISK INTO DRIVE ONE.  READ ANY TRACK
ON  THIS  DISK AND SCAN THROUGH THE MEMORY ADDRESSES.   THERE WILL BE NO  GAPS
FOUND,  AND  MANY OF THE BYTES SEEN ON A TRACK LIKE THIS WILL END IN  0  (I.E.
$A0,$B0,$E0),  WHICH ARE NOT LEGAL DISK BYTES.  THIS MEANS THAT THE CONTROLLER
CAN FIND NO VALID DATA ON THE TRACK.  SOME DISKS HAVE PORTIONS OF TRACKS WHICH
ARE NOT USED,  SO YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE SURE TO EXAMINE AT LEAST 24 SCREENFULLS
OF INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO DATA AT ANY POINT ON THE TRACK.
     OUR  NEXT  TOOL FOR FINDING DATA IS THE FACT THAT VALID DATA MUST  BE  AT
LEAST 1 TRACK APART.   IN OTHER WORDS,  IF YOU LOCATE DATA ON TRACK 3.5,  THEN
TRACK  4  CANNOT HAVE DATA AND THE NEXT PLACE WHERE DATA CAN BE IS TRACK  4.5.
THIS IS VERY HELPFUL FOR FINDING TRACKS WITH DATA.

NOTE: IF  YOU LOCATE DATA ON A GIVEN TRACK,  IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO LOOK AT  THE
     TRACKS  ONE HALF TRACK TO EITHER SIDE,  TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY LOOK  LESS
     VALID THAN THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE SELECTED AS THE REAL ONE.

     WELL,  NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO LOACATE DATA ON A TRACK,  WE CAN BEGIN  AT
TRACK 0 AND STEP TOWARDS TRACK 22, CHECKING EACH TRACK TO SEE IF IT APPEARS TO
HAVE DATA ON IT.   MOST DISKS HAVE A PATTERN TO THE POSITION OF THE DATA,  AND
IF  YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT,  YOU MAY BE ABLE TO JUST CHECK A FEW TRACKS TO MAKE
SURE,  AND THEN GO ON TO STEP 2.  OTHERWISE THE DATA MUST BE LOCATED ONE TRACK
AT A TIME.
     MOST  DISKS USE THE STANDARD TRACKS (1,2,3,...,22),  BUT THERE  ARE  SOME
WHICH  USE HALF-TRACKS AND SOME WHICH USE ALL THE WAY OUT TO TRACK 23  (WHICH,
BY  THE WAY CANNOT BE READ ON ALL DRIVES SINCE NO DRIVES WERE EVER DESIGNED TO
GO OUT THAT FAR).
     WHEN ALL TRACKS WHICH CONTAIN SOME TYPE OF DATA ARE LOCATED,  WE CAN MOVE
ON TO STEP 2.

STEP 2:
     NOW  WE  MUST  TELL NIBBLES AWAY ][ HOW TO READ THE  INFORMATION  ON  THE
TRACKS WHICH WE HAVE FOUND TO CONTAIN VALID DATA.   THIS IS DONE BY GOING BACK
TO  EACH  OF THESE TRACKS WITH THE TBE AND FINDING THE ADDRESS MARK  FOR  EACH
ONE.   THE ADDRESS MARK WILL BE THE FIRST 3 BYTES FOLLOWING THE GAP.   TO  SEE
THIS IN OPERATION, TAKE A LOOK AT A TRACK FROM YOUR SYSTEM MASTER DISK.  AFTER
EACH  GAP YOU WILL SEE EITHER 'D5 AA 96' FOR A DOS 3.3 MASTER DISK,  OR 'D5 AA
B5' FOR A DOS 3.2 DISK.   THESE VALUES SHOULD BE NOTED DOWN ALONGSIDE OF  EACH
TRACK NUMBER WHICH CONTAINS DATA.  MANY TIMES THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE, OR MAYBE
2 PATTERNS FOR ALL TRACKS.
     AFTER  THIS,  WE  ARE  READY TO BACK-UP THESE TRACKS.   THIS IS  DONE  BY
EXITING THE TBE (USE 'Q') AND THEN SELECTING 'M' FOR THE MODIFIERS MENU.  THEN
SELECT 'B' FOR BACKUP MODIFIER.   WHEN ASKED 'USE ADDRESS MARK' ANSWER 'Y' AND
THEN TYPE IN THE ADDRESS MARK WHICH YOU NOTED DOWN FOR THE RANGE OF TRACKS  TO
BE  BACKED-UP.   SIMPLY  PRESS  RETURN TO THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS  AND  THEN
RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU.   SELECT 'N' TO ENTER NIBBLES AWAY ][, AND ANSWER 'Y'
TO THE QUESTION 'CHANGE DEFAULT OPTIONS'.  USE THE <RETURN> KEY TO MOVE TO THE
'START TRACK' PROMPT,  AND THEN ENTER THE FIRST TRACK TO BE BACKED-UP.   PRESS
RETURN  AND  THEN  TYPE IN THE LAST TRACK TO BE  BACKED-UP  WITH  THE  CURRENT
ADDRESS  MARKER SETTING.   IF THE TRACKS IN THE SPECIFIED RANGE ARE NOT SPACED
AT  1  TRACK INTERVALS,  ENTER THE INTERVAL AT THE 'TRACK  INCREMENT'  PROMPT.
PRESS RETURN FOR THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND BEGIN THE BACKUP AFTER  INSERTING
THE DISKS WHEN PROMPTED.   WHEN YOU RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU,  REPEAT THE ABOVE
PROCEDURE  FOR EACH RANGE OF TRACKS WHICH CONTAINS A DIFFERENT ADDRESS MARKER.
     NOW COMES THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!  TRY TO BOOT UP THE BACKED-UP DISK (IF THE
ORIGINAL  HAD A WRITE-PROTECT TAB,  THE BACK-UP SHOULD TOO!).   IF THE  BACKUP
BOOTS, THEN ALL WENT SUCCESFULLY.

STEP 3:
     IF THE BACK-UP DID NOT WORK PROPERLY THEN THERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO  LOOK
FOR.

1....DID  ALL  OF THE TRACKS WHICH SHOULD HAVE BACKED-UP DO SO?   THIS CAN  BE
     SEEN  WHILE THE BACK-UP TAKES PLACE AS A 'Y' OR AN 'N' UNDER THAT  TRACKS
     STATUS LOCATION.   IF SOME DID NOT,  THEN THE ADDRESS MARKER WAS PROBABLY
     NOT DETERMINED PROPERLY.   IF THIS IS THE CASE,  THEN GO BACK TO THE  TBE
     AND TRY THOSE TRACKS AGAIN.
2....IF EVERYTHING SEEMED TO GO WELL,  BUT THE BACKUP REFUSES TO WORK (YOU MAY
     WANT  TO TRY THE PROCEDURE AGAIN,  MAYBE WITH THE SOURCE AND  DESTINATION
     DRIVES  REVERSED,  TO  MAKE SURE IT WAS NOT A POWER GLITCH OR OTHER  SUCH
     OCCURANCE  WHICH MESSED THINGS UP) THE NEXT STEP IS TO TRY THE  PROCEDURE
     WITH  THE  'SYNCHRONIZED COPY' OPTION SELECTED.   DISKS  WHICH  USE  THIS
     METHOD  OFTEN  MAKE VIOLENT HEAD MOVEMENTS DURING THEIR  BOOT  PROCEDURE.
     THIS CAN BE A CLUE TO THIS TYPE OF PROTECTION.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
     ON  SOME DOS 3.3 DISKETTES,  THE GAPS BETWEEN THE SECTORS ARE REDUCED  IN
SIZE.   IN  SOME  CASES  THEY  CAN  BE  AS  SMALL  AS  4  OR  5  BYTES.   WHEN
NIBBLES  AWAY ][ FINDS THE BEGINNING OF A SECTION OF DATA,  IT NORMALLY ADDS 8
BYTES  OF SYNC JUST BEFORE THE DATA.   THIS WILL NORMALLY PUT SYNC BYTES  INTO
THE  GAP BEFORE THE DATA,  WHERE IT SHOULD BE.   HOWEVER,  IF A DISK HAS  VERY
SMALL GAPS,  THEN THE ADDED SYNC CAN OVERWRITE THE END OF THE PREVIOUS SECTOR.
THE PARAMETER FIX AMNT CONTROLS THE NUMBER OF SYNC BYTES WHICH ARE  ADDED,  SO
THIS  VALUE  CAN BE REDUCED TO PREVENT ANY DATA FROM BEING  OVERWRITTEN.   THE
VALUE THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ USES FOR THE SYNC WHICH IT PUTS IN IS CONTAINED  IN
THE  PARAMETER  FIX VALU.   NORMALLY THIS IS A $7F,  BUT IT CAN BE SET TO  ANY
DESIRED VALUE.
    IT  SHOULD BE NOTED THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ REGARDS ANY DATA BYTE  WHICH  HAS
ITS HIGH BIT CLEARED TO BE A SYNC BYTE.   SO THE $7F WHICH IS NORMALLY IN THIS
PARAMETER MEANS THAT A SYNC $FF IS TO BE ADDED.  IF THE 'OVERIDE STANDARDIZER'
OPTION  IS  SELECTED,  THEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ WILL NOT ADD ANY  BYTES,  IT  WILL
SIMPLY  CONVERT THE DATA WHICH IS PRESENT BEFORE A SECTOR INTO  SYNC,  WITHOUT
CHANGING ITS VALUE.   THIS TECHNIQUE CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DISKS WHOSE GAPS ARE
VERY SMALL.

     ANOTHER  ITEM TO WATCH FOR IS DISKS WHOSE TRACKS APPEAR TO BE VERY  LONG.
SOME DISK PROTECTION SCHEMES PUT GARBAGE ON A PORTION OF THE TRACK.  WHEN THIS
GARBAGE  IS  READ BACK,  MORE BYTES ARE READ IN THAN WERE WRITTEN  OUT.   THIS
CAUSES  THE TRACK TO BE LONGER THAN NORMAL,  AND IN SOME CASES IT  BECOMES  SO
LONG  THAT  THE  DEFAULT PARAMETERS FOR NIBBLES AWAY ][ CANNOT FIND  THE  DATA
PROPERLY.   THE  PARAMETERS  DATA  MIN AND DATA MAX CONTROL  THE  MINUMUM  AND
MAXIMUM TRACK LENGTHS (IN INCREMENTS OF 256 BYTES) WHICH NIBBLES AWAY ][  WILL
ACCOMODATE.   THE  NORMAL VALUE OF DATA MAX IS $1D,  BUT THIS CAN BE SET TO  A
HIGHER VALUE,  SUCH AS $25,  IF A TRACK APPEARS TO BE VERY LONG.   EVEN THOUGH
THE  TRACK  MAY  READ IN AS A LARGE NUMBER OF BYTES,  MANY OF  THESE  WILL  BE
REMOVED BY THE NIBBLE FILTER,  SINCE THEY ARE GARBAGE BYTES.  THIS WILL ASSURE
THAT  THE  AMOUNT OF DATA WRITTEN BACK OUT WILL NOT BE TO LARGE TO FIT ON  THE
DESTINATION TRACK.

     WHEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ FINDS A SECTOR OF DATA, IT LOOKS FORWARD IN THE DATA
TO FIND A SECOND OCCURANCE OF THE SAME PATTERN.   THIS INSURES THAT THE SECTOR
HAS  BEEN READ IN AND LOCATED CORRECTLY.   ON MANY DISKS,  THERE IS A  PRIMARY
SECTION  OF  DATA,  CALLED THE ADDRESS FIELD,  AND THE THE ACTUAL  DATA  FIELD
FOLLOWS.   IN BETWEEN THESE IS A SMALL GAP,  AND MANY TIMES IT CONTAINS RANDOM
INFORMATION.   THIS MEANS THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ SHOULD ONLY MATCH THE NUMBER OF
BYTES WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE ADDRESS FIELD, SINCE THE BYTES IN THE GAP MAY NOT
READ AS THE SAME VALUE EVERY TIME.  THE PARAMETER FIND MAX CONTROLS THE NUMBER
OF  BYTES WHICH ARE CHECKED DURING THIS PROCEDURE.   THE DEFAULT VALUE OF  $0C
WORKS  IN  MOST CASES,  BUT SOME DISKS USE A SMALLER ADDRESS FIELD  WHICH  MAY
REQUIRE  THIS  PARAMETER  TO BE SET TO A  SMALLER  VALUE.   HOWEVER,  IF  THIS
PARAMETER  IS SET TOO LOW,  THEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ MAY IDENTIFY THE MATCH FOR  A
SECTION OF DATA WHOSE FIRST FEW BYTES ARE THE SAME, BUT WHICH DIFFER LATER ON.
THEREFORE ONE SHOULD EXCERSIZE CAUTION WHEN LOWERING THIS VALUE.

         FUN STUFF FOR SYSOPS
---------------------------------------
First, you must be a sysop. 
(Obviously!) Or, you may be at a 
sysop's house (When he or she is not
around.)

Second, you must be VERY popular,
or VERY daring. Either way, your
victim will have a strong dendency
to: a) crash your board, b) hate you, 
or c) spread malicious rumors about
you, and, or your board to everyone
in the world that will listen.
 
    I am going to write about AE
fun first, and then Net-Worx. 
 
 
                AE Fun
                -- ---
 
    So you are bored, and want to
have some fun, huh?
    Go into your room, or wherever
you have your apple, and sit down.
Turn on the monitor, and lets see
if there is a leech on the line.
(-note: if you are the unlucky type,
I suggest that you give this up,
because for all you know, that sysop
of the 20meg board is on your line,
and he's going to be your victim!!)
   Now for some of these pranks, you
will need to make things before-
hand. I suggest you read this through,
and make the necessary mods. 
 
1) This one is probably my meanest
trick, and should only be used on
people like Matt Ackerett, or Little
Al.
   Your victim has to be leeching
a game off of your AE for this to
work.
   You wait until your victim is at
his last 2 blocks of memeory to go
until the transfer is done, and
you take out the disk. 
   This will ruin the >entire<
transmission. It won't piss them off
too bad if it is only 50 or so blocks,
but can you imagine:
 
Send: Matt Ackerett is a fag
290 blocks
crc=167
<289>
 
    Note- The victim has to get 290
blocks, you only let the victim get
289!
 
 
   At that point, take out the disk!
They have just waited 1/2 hour for
nothing! They can't get the last block
and have to go through the whole
thing again!! Ha ha!  
   This is very mean, especially if
they aren't phreaking, they have
been >paying< for it all!
 
             
2) If you want to see if the person
on is intelligent...simply let him
catalog your drive once, then when he
is done, take the disk out, and 
put in the disk from the other drive.
When they catalog the disk next, it 
will be different!
   This will freak them out, they will
think that they have switched to d1
somehow. The victim will then L)og the
drive, and find it still on D2. Wow!
   Hopefully they will catalog D1 
anyway, thinking that they were
originally on D1 and it switched.
Now comes the fun. 
   Put the right disk back in D2, 
and put the disk that used to be in D2
into D1, so they will get the same 
catalog.
   Now they are confused. Now
they will catalog D2, and find the
normal stuff. Hopefull they will
read something, now take the disk
out while they are typing in the name,
and slip the other disk in. It
will say 'file not found.'
   Good. Now they will catalog it,
and look! The wares have changed!
Now something is wrong here! They
will say:
 
hey! stop it!
 
   Oh no! They are on to your scheme!
But, 1 last joke! Get a copy-protected
type disk, one that you <gasp> bought.
They won't be able to catalog this
at all! Ha!
   If they get mad, they might
say something like:
 
        Hey! Stop it!
   
   But will you listen? nnnoooooo!
Take the disk out, and slip something
totally new, preferably the disk that
has "sneakers" or some ancient wares.
Maybe they will think these are the
latest! Watch them post!:
 
      Hey! I just got some new 
      Warez! Do you want to trade??
 
hah hah!
 
  Satisfied, you may put the normal
disks back in and walk off to see
some football game.
 
3) Lock out the space-bar. This will
make it so that they can't type a
<space>. Then, they can't read
anything that requires a space. 
Most likely the victim will think that
there is something wrong with >his< 
computer. Thusly sending him/her/it
into a 1/2 hour scan of their install
program to see what is wrong.
 
4) Change the commands...such as:
 
d)irectory= c)irectory
-           -
 
   They will have to hack at the 
commands! This won't be too funny,
because they won't do anything stupid
like posting:
 
     hey your commands are screwed!
  
   Most likely they wont find the 
command for 'copy'.
 
 
5) lock out the "ctrl-c". This will
piss them off when the victim just
can't exit from posting. Ha!
 
6) Change the ring count, most, or
almost >all< AE lines are set to 
pick up after just 1 ring. Change it
to...say...5 rings, and only tell your
friends that it is at 5 rings. When
they call, they will only wait for 
about 2 rings, and hang up thinking
that the line is down. Only the people
you like will get on, because they 
will be the only ones to wait 5 rings.
Mean huh?
 
7) When someone is posting, or c)opy-
ing a message, pick up the voice line,
and blow into the reciever. This will
put all of these weird characters onto
the screen. He will save a gay looking
message, that will make it look like
the victim can't type!! 
 
 
               Net Works
               --- -----
 
   I don't have as many fun tricks
with net-worx as I do with AE, but
here are a couple of my favorites...
 
1) In the program, make a bug, like
"ctrl-k" that when pushed (like ctrl-t
for chat) it will dump you into basic.
take out the disks, and put in like 
the "bare-bones" net-worx disk and let
them have fun reading fake messages,
mail, and passwords. Ooooh! They will
think:
 
oh yay! I have everyone's pass!
 
Now, see if he/she will init the 
disks, if they do, you know what type
of user it is. If they are nice,
and 'hang' the line for you so that
no one wil be able to get on after,
or they try to beep you, then give 
them a level raise.
 
2) Be a tyrant. Juggle their levels
while they are on. Like break into
chat, change their level, and watch
them get all mad. 
 
3) Break into chat, and just walk off,
leaving a frustrated user sitting
there.
 
4) break into chat, and change the
time. In other words, leave them
with -10 minutes, instead of 35 or
so.
 
5) when they log off, and they get
that stupid message about:
 
            Thank you for
              calling
 
and all of that, press 'ctrl-c' a
few times, and they will be brought
back. Wow! What happened? Let them
try to log off a few times nd keep
pressing ctrl-c. Finally they should
just press 'reset'. He he!
 
 
    I hope you have enjoyed these
little pranks. Your users will hate
you if you do this too often, unless
they are like Matt Ackeret or Little
Al. Then it doesn't matter much.
    Remember! I hold no responsibilty
for people wanting to crash your 
system because they are so pissed
at you!

     Greetings.  A lot of work went into this file.  I spent many long nights
tracking down these little gems that to this day still leave me smiling.
They are the last undiscovered relic of the Apple pirate world.  They remain
hidden on your disks, unknown, unrealized, waiting to be discovered, perhaps
finally now, perhaps never.  Never to be known by anyone except for the
person who planted it in the first place.  Call me weird, but there's a
certain mystique about them.  Its like finding an old coin buried in your
back yard:  it was there, waiting to be dug up,  and you didn't even realize
it.  Or finding that last easter egg (hence the name) on that certain Sunday
when you were but a little guy.  I am speaking of what I prefer to call
"secret keys".  I always got off on finding the things.  To think that years
ago, someone, somewhere, added something a little special to their work for
someone to find later is, well, real neat.

     This file is older than promises of an upgrade for the //gs...literally
(by the way, those of you still holding out hope, give it up).  I finally
felt it was time to put aside my perfectionist tendencies and put it out with
some incomplete or un-researched entries.  I used to tirelessly pursue every
lead I could in order to track down secret keys and the like; calling
different pirate friends around the country and asking them about ones I had
heard rumors of; searching disks sector by sector looking for funny or
interesting messages; boot tracing nearly every single one of my cracked
games to see if the title page routine included some check for a special
keypress.  I put a lot of time and effort into this file, and hope that the
few people who will take the time to read it will possibly gain some
enjoyment from checking out these gems for themselves.  This file was started
almost two years ago (I can't believe it myself).  If you're like me, you
still have most of these games or programs stuffed away in disk cases that
you rarely dig into anymore (mine make great dust collectors).  Now you have
a chance to re-live some of those fond memories of playing cool Apple games
well into the wee hours.  Perhaps not, but give it a whirl anyway, you might
enjoy some of the things you discover for the first time.

     A lot of these games are ancient (some a decade old!) and you probably
don't and won't ever have them.  I do have most of them (except for the GS
stuff...I don't have a GS and probably never will unless I can get one for
under $100...any offers?)  Of course, some of the more obscure hardware
easter eggs will be a challenge for those of you who will attempt to
experience every single secret key documented in this file.  As if anyone is
actually going to try, but if you are, try going to your school or some place
where they have old outdated Apple's.  You may even find some of the older
games still making the rounds in programming class when the twits should be
coding rather than playing Mario Bros.

     I had hoped to make this guide as complete and up-to-date as possible,
but considering its been aeons since I last touched it, I felt I may as well
release it now or never release it at all.  I don't know what kind of
audience this file will receive, but I hope the few people who do take the
time to get it are pleased with the effort I took to present them with these
gems and hope they enjoy them as much as I do.

     The Apple Pirate world was a killer playground for me: all the different
BBS' and the interesting types I met in different corners of the country.
The dead and lonely back-alley wares boards and the thriving elyte message
systems.  There will never be another community, another sub-society like it.
The 80's were a decade of advancement for all computers, but Apples and Apple
users led the way.  Apple users were the innovators, the originators.  The
pirate code of honor (and dishonor) that spawned from the Apple world, all
the words (K-K00L!), customs (crack screens and rag pages) found their way
into many different areas of the computer world as a whole.  Atari and
Commodore 64 groups hoped to only come close to the rich Apple pirate
traditions.  Oh, the bustling commerce of wares being traded between
different warehouse Meccas of pirated games!  But of course, all empires must
fall, or be absorbed into a greater whole.

     Near the end, other computers' pirating customs began spilling back
into the Apple realm, and it was completely lame.  But by then, the Apple
world was pretty much extinct anyway, only being carried on by those die-hard
romantics hoping to effect some sort of revival.  Now the Apple modem world
is but a ghost of what it once was.  Lonely, desolate, Apple BBS' are few and
far between.  I sometimes call out, now only to one and sometimes two Apple
BBS'.  The Apple may be dead, but then, so are a lot of other computers.  The
90s are here, man.  Things are changing real fast.  Apple and IBM working
together?  MicroSoft and IBM, splitsville?  Its so diverse out there now.
Don't hold back.  Use your Apple experience as a stepping stone onto other
platforms.  There's so much out there to try...

     Well, I got carried away, but since this is in all likelihood my last
major Apple world contribution, what the fuck.


                             :Acknowledgements:

Thanks to Hot Rod (where ever the hell he is these days) for publishing the
first secret key files and turning me on to this entertaining pastime and
for finding all the secret keys he did.  Also, thanks go to Apple Core for
the secret keys he found and published in his "Secret Game Keys" file.
Finally, thanks to the many people that informed me of new ones I hadn't
known about.  This file basically compiles all previously published secret
keys plus the few ones I have located into this one source guide.


These are the different types of "Easter Eggs" you will find listed in this
file:

1) Secret Key (a single keypress that results in some action, such as a
   message being displayed)
2) Password (a series of keypresses that result in some action)
3) Hidden message (a message embedded somewhere in a program or somewhere on
   a disk)
4) Game cheat (a sequence of keypresses that leads to some sort of game
   cheat)

I have even included some hardware Easter Eggs!  These are ones found in
certain pieces of Apple hardware that I have deemed significant.

An entry that has "(unverified)" next to the name of the ware indicates that
I have not been able to verify that entry, but am including it for you to
explore.  No claim is made as to the actual existence of an easter egg for
that particular entry.

Enjoy!

Advanced Pirate's Signature

A) Press [ESC] at the main menu for a hidden page
B) Press [CTRL-C] at the hidden page to enter the monitor

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Airheart (Evil Sock's 16 sector crack; unverified)

A) Use a sector editor to view a message embedded on Track $00, Sector $2
B) Boot a DOS 3.3, insert your Airheart disk in the drive and then enter the
   following:

     CALL -151
     300: A9 00 8D EB B7 8D F0 B7 A9 21 8D EC B7 A9 0A 8D
     310: ED B7 A9 04 8D F1 B7 A9 01 8D F4 B7 20 E3 03 20
     320: D9 03 CE ED B7 EE F1 B7 AD F1 B7 C9 08 D0 ED 2C
     330: 00 C0 10 FB 2C 10 C0 A9 04 8D F1 B7 AD ED B7 C9
     340: 02 D0 D9 60
     300G

   This enters the monitor and creates a short program which loads some
   sectors off of the Airheart disk which contains a message from The Evil
   Sock.  I assume there is (or was) a way to load this message using a
   secret key but I was unable to figure it out.

(I tried contacting The Evil Sock to find out just how to access these
messages from a secret key.  No go.  I tore the game apart and looked for the
possible secret keys myself.  What I found instead were his routines to crash
the game if his text crack pages were changed in any way.  Neat, but no
secret keys to be found.)

     The following are file games which contain messages embedded within
them that I didn't feel merited a specific entry.  Use a file view utility to

You may want to venture ahead and do a little snooping yourself.  A note is

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

----------
Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent

  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a

  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for

  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.
    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)

  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to

  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

----------
Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?
Date: 4 May 90

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug

  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,

  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs

  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are

  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent

  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit

  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a

  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a

  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of

  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

Some opinions on leaving your computer on 24 hours a day and mounting
your machine sideways.
===============================================================================
This is the version that was included in the Frequently Asked Questions
file until May 1990:

There's a lot of stress placed on the system when it first comes up.
Generally, you should leave your system running if you plan to return
within the next few hours or so; if you don't expect to be using it for
a day or so, whether or not you turn it off is a personal judgement call.

Monitors aren't the same, though, since images can get "burned into"
the phosphor.  Use a screen blanker, or turn it off if you'll be away
for more than five or ten minutes.

As for mounting it sideways: The most common myth about this is that
it will make the disk drive bearings wear unevenly. If you look at the
manufacturer's information when you buy a disk drive, you will see
that it is warrantied in any position *except*upside-down* (with the
defect label down). However, the disk may hang slightly differently in
the bearings after being placed on its side, so if you plan on
mounting your system sideways, you should back up your hard disk while
it's level, then mount your system sideways and do a low-level
reformat of your hard disk and restore it from the backup you made. If
you do this you shouldn't have problems.

I can provide some info on the phenomonon.  Semiconductors have failure
curves that look like:

	||
	||
Failures||				
	| \			       /...
	|   \			      /
	|_____\______________ ... ___/__
	0    100                   1E6 = ~100 years
		Hours of use

The failures in the first 100 hours are some times called Infant mortality.
I'm not sure at all about the 1E6 hours (Lets say it's a lot of hours!)

The first 100 hours failures are the reason the most reputable manufacturers
will "Burn-in" new systems.  Statistics shows that there is little gain in
confidence by burn-ins much longer than 100 hours.

NASA (I think) found that semiconductors that had been left on for a long,
long time were very likely to fail if their power was cycled off then on again.

However, statistics showed that the same semiconductor if just left on would
continue to work almost indefinitly.

As I recall the failures due to cycling power occured while the power was off.
it had something to do with the transistor's junctions migrating too close
together while power was off, then when power was turned on, the transistor
failed because the junctions were shorted. (power being on continuously 
apparently prevents this) Anyone know more about this?

These are the tests that everyone alludes to when they tell you to leave
computers and other electronics on all the time for greater life.  They
only mean something if you have a statistically large number of transistors
(the transistors need to be from different lots not just a large number on an
IC) in your system, and you are using the system for a LARGE number of hours.

Your individual PC does NOT have a statistically large number of semiconductors
in it.  The entire country's PC's do.  100 years is a long time.

Conclusions that I think you should draw from this diatribe:

	1) Big computers that have millions of IC's in them perhaps should
	   be left on.
	2) Small computers (PC's etc) It just won't matter.

Note: Failures of mechanical parts are nothing like that of semiconductors!
      (You know, disk drives, switches, keyboards, fans, etc.)

	I wish I could provide references to all of what I have stated, but
I can't easily.  This is stuff that I have gleaned from years as an Engineer,
and many many hours of college course work.  So some settling may have
occurred :-)

----------
Long long ago, in a far away place, when I worked for a high volume
computer manufacturer, I ran across some real statistics.  Some
experiments had been done on the difference in failure rates between
continuous burn-in and power cycling.  My dim recollection is that there
was a significant increase in the infant mortality rate of the group
that underwent power cycling.

The sample size was large enough to be statistically convincing. The
primary cause of the failures was due to thermal shock on solder joints,
IC bonds, sockets and connectors.

Alas I no longer have access to the details of that experiment.  What I
now do is to frequently power cycle new equipment (while it's still under
warranty of course) to shake out the lemons, and to minimize power cycles
thereafter.  I still have seen no good data on electromechanical
equipment, like disk drives.

Power conditioning must play a part in the equation.  If one's AC supply is
relatively dirty and one has limited power conditioning equipment, then leaving
one's system on constantly leaves it open to large power glitches wreaking
havoc.

My floppy drive fails to read some disks when cold.  So, I leave it
on.  After three years, the only thing that died is the cheap 12V fan
in my UL listed power supply.  $15 and a trip to Radio Shmuck did the
trick.  It's still ticking.

Just be sure to use a good screen blanker program.  Most of our machines
at work are never turned off.

But.  My 386 at work ate two hard drives and three motherboards before
they replaced the power supply.  The +5v line ran at 5.2v while the
other voltages were acceptable with low electrical noise.  New supply
and it works great.

Before deciding whether to leave it on or not.  Consider these points:

  Does your system draw air into the box through a vent on the back?
  If you feel air being blown out the vent on the power supply, then
  it is most likely sucking it in through the biggest hole:  your 
  floppy drive.   When air comes in through the drive door, it drops the 
  dust it was carrying all over your machine, mostly on your disk drive. 
  Remedy:  replace the power supply with one that has the fan going 
  in the right direction.  Swapping the Red and Black wires on it won't
  do.  You will cause irrepairable damage to the solid-state controller
  (they don't have brushes like conventional DC motors to control noise).
  I had to open the power supply box (after removing it from my machine)
  unscrew the fan mounting hardware and turn it over so that it draws air
  in from the vent that sticks out the back of the cabinet when installed.

  With your fan now drawing air from one place, you can tape a piece of
  foam or air filter material over that vent to catch a large percentage
  of the dust before it gets inside.  But, you must check the filter
  regularly.  The entire system may be at risk with a blocked air filter.
  Or, if anything, your expansion boards will attract the dust before it 
  reaches your floppy drives.  Unfortunately, too much dust on the
  motherboard or expansion boards will insulate the chips and prevent
  them from keeping cool. 

  If you have large expansion boards or full height hard drives,
  look into adding additional fans.  Some cabinets allow you to have a 
  second one on the front end of the expansion card cage.  If you don't
  want to open your machine and it overheats or attracts dust in all
  the wrong places, turn it off if possible.  Machines today are durable.

Safety warning.  If you don't feel comfortable opening your machine,
find someone who is.  If your dealer doesn't feel comfortable, find
another dealer.  The one you have now probably can't fix it if it dies. 
The power supply circuit can still hold a charge when it is unplugged.
You shouldn't have to touch any of the circuits on the power supply
board.  You aren't rewiring it, you're flipping the fan over and putting
the screws back in.  

That wasn't hard.  Was it?

Even though most of the components in a PC are NOT light bulbs ( and don't
behave like one either), I would agree with you that leaving it on is best
if the ONLY consideration was hardware reliability (and it is connected to
a stable power source).  As I see it, however, hardware reliability is not
the only issue and a case can be made for the theory that a properly designed
disk drive will wear out from heat and friction and dirt before it will
suffer any electrical damage from being started and stopped once a day.
I think that all the energy wasted by millions of PCs left on 128 hours a
week when they are not being used is a bigger and more important issue than 
whether or not it will extend your repair cycle from 3 years to 5 years.
There is also a small extra potential for a fire in a running device.

I have been in the computer industry for close to 25 years, mostly as a
technician.  I have weighed all the arguments and I have decided to turn
MY machines off when they will not be needed for 6 hours or more.  I even
turn the Xenix box off over the weekends.  

Like a lot of other things in modern life, this is not strictly a technical
call but it has some moral undertones too.   Make your own call but don't
overlook part of the factors in the process.

  Maybe the solution is to flip the thing from end to end every 6 months to
even out warpage?  ;-)

  But seriously, folks, when I was a PC tech I did see some problems with this. 
Essentially, it seems that the larger the number of cards you have, how big the
cards themselves are (height/thickness) and how good your fan is are the big
factors.  Remember, these cards are designed to stand on edge and let the heat
float to the top of the box where it can be sucked away by the fan.  A PC on
its side screws up this system and the heat, trying to rise, gets caught by the
cards and what you end up with are little heat sandwiches between the cards -
the hot air has nowhere to go.  I have seen machines with lots of big cards in
them that you could fry an egg on.  The biggest danger with cards "melting" is
not only that the card itself may malfunction, but that it wil come in contact
with something it shouldn't (usually another card, the one below it) and short
out the whole works.  I have seen motherboards die this way.

  This can be alleviated by some things such as:
1) a fan (a standard room fan pointing at the machine),
2) room A/C,
3) simply leaving the cover off the machine and covering it with a cloth
   supported by a wire frame (to hold the cloth away from the machine a
   few inches)
4) If the cards are long enough, mounting brackets at the front of the machine
   for the ends of long cards to rest in will prevent "drooping" at the ends
   but alas, cards still droop in the middle.

My best advice: Unless you have only a monochrome card and a serial/parallel
card, or some other very low heat/high circulation setup inside the machine,
place it the way it was designed to be placed - "power users" take note.  The
equipment is too expensive and your time too valuable to waste with breakdowns. 
Would you want your PC to die in the middle of a presentation because the
Video card just warped enough to touch the drive controller and short out the
whole works?  BTW, though, I have found that smart terminals like Novell
network PCs work OK on end - as long as the novell card is about the only thing
in the machine.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Is it [orientation] harmful to disk drives?

Dunno about floppies.  For hard drives it depends upon the manufacturer. All of
the Seagate manuals I've seen, for instance, are VERY specific in their manuals
about not elevating the front or back more than 5 degrees from horizontal.
They can however be turned on their sides up to 90 degrees, but no further (ie
not upside down).  They should also be formatted in their permanent
orientation.  My understanding is that the head positioning mechanism gets worn
out on an angle, and the motor bearings can't hack being upside down.  On the
phone, Seagate told me that they would not honor any warrantee if they know
that it has exceeded those limits.  I've heard some newer Seagates don't have
limits, but don't know for sure, nor do I know about the CDC's.  Conner,
Quantum, Miniscribe, Maxtor(?), on the other hand, (of the ones I've seen)
specifically say "any orientation".

  valid.(rbs)

  TWELVE REASONS TO LEGALIZE DRUGS


  There are no panaceas in the world but, for social afflictions,
  legalizing drugs comes possibly as close as any single policy could.
  Removing legal penalties from the production, sale and use of
  "controlled substances" would alleviate at least a dozen of our biggest
  social or political problems.

  With proposals for legalization finally in the public eye, there
  might be a use for some sort of catalog listing the benefits of
  legalization. For advocates, it is an inventory of facts and arguments.
  For opponents, it is a record of the problems they might be helping to
  perpetuate.
  The list is intended both as a resource for those wishing to
  participate in the legalization debate and as a starting point for
  those wishing to get deeper into it.

  Are we ready to stop wringing our hands and start solving problems?

  1.  Legalizing drugs would make our streets and homes safer.

  As Jeffrey Rogers Hummel notes ("Heroin: The Shocking Story," April
  1988), estimates vary widely for the proportion of violent and property
  crime related to drugs.  Forty percent is a midpoint figure.  In an
  October 1987 survey by Wharton Econometrics for the U.S. Customs
  Service, the 739 police chiefs responding "blamed drugs for a fifth of
  the murders and rapes, a quarter car thefts, two-fifths of robberies
  and assaults and half the nation's burglaries and thefts."

  The theoretical and statistical links between drugs and crime are
  well established.  In a 2 1/2-year study of Detroit crime, Lester P.
  Silverman, former associate director of the National Academy of
  Sciences' Assembly of Behavior and Social Sciences, found that a 10
  percent increase in the price of heroin alone "produced an increase of
  3.1 percent  total property crimes in poor nonwhite neighborhoods."
  Armed robbery jumped 6.4 percent and simple assault by 5.6 percent
  throughout the city.
  The reasons are not difficult to understand.  When law enforcement
  restricts the supply of drugs, the price of drugs rises.  In 1984, a
  kilogram of cocaine worth $4000 in Colombia sold at wholesale for
  $30,000, and at retail in the United States for some $300,000.  At the
  time a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman noted,
  matter-of-factly, that the wholesale price doubled in six months "due
  to crackdowns on producers and smugglers in Columbia and the U.S."
  There are no statistics indicating the additional number of people
  killed or mugged thanks to the DEA's crackdown on cocaine.

  For heroin the factory-to-retail price differential is even
  greater. According to U.S. News & World report, in 1985 a gram of pure
  heroin in Pakistan cost $5.07, but it sold for $2425 on the street in
  America--nearly a five-hundredfold jump.

  The unhappy consequence is that crime also rises, for at least four
  reasons:
  *   Addicts must shell out hundreds of times the cost of goods, so
  they often must turn to crime to finance their habits.  The higher the
  price goes, the more they need to steal to buy the same amount.
  *   At the same time, those who deal or purchase the stuff find
  themselves carrying extremely valuable goods, and become attractive
  targets for assault.
  *  Police officers and others suspected of being informants for law
  enforcement quickly become targets for reprisals.
  *  The streets become literally a battleground for "turf" among
  competing dealers, as control over a particular block or intersection
  can net thousands of additional drug dollars per day.

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.

    The following is reprinted from The Pragmatist, August 1988.  Some of
  the examples and data are dated, but the arguments are still
  valid.(rbs)

  Conversely, if and when drugs are legalized, their price will
  collapse and so will the sundry drug-related motivations to commit
  crime.  Consumers will no longer need to steal to support their habits.
  A packet of cocaine will be as tempting to grab from its owner as a
  pack of cigarettes is today.  And drug dealers will be pushed out of
  the retail market by known retailers.  When was the last time we saw
  employees of Rite Aid pharmacies shoot it out with Thrift Drugs for a
  corner storefront?
  When drugs become legal, we will be able to sleep in our homes and
  walk the streets more safely.  As one letter-writer to the Philadelphia
  Inquirer put it, "law-abiding citizens will be able to enjoy not living
  in fear of assault and burglary."


  2.  It would put an end to prison overcrowding.

  Prison overcrowding is a serious and persistent problem.  It makes
  the prison environment, violent and faceless to begin with, even more
  dangerous and dehumanizing.

  According to the 1988 Statistical Abstract of the United States,
  between 1979 and 1985 the number of people in federal and state prisons
  and local jails grew by 57.8 percent, nine time faster than the general
  population.
  Governments at all levels keep building more prisons, but the number
  of prisoners keeps outpacing the capacity to hold them.  According to
  the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 1985 Statistical Report, as of September
  30 of that year federal institutions held 35,959 prisoners-41 percent
  over the rated prison capacity of 25,638.  State prisons were 114
  percent of capacity in 1986.

  Of 31,346 sentenced prisoners in federal institutions, those in for
  drug law violations were the largest single category, 9487. (A total of
  4613 were in prison but not yet sentenced under various charges.)

  Legalizing drugs would immediately relieve the pressure on the
  prison system, since there would no longer be "drug offenders" to
  incarcerate. And, since many drug users would no longer need to commit
  violent or property crime to pay for their habits, there would be fewer
  "real" criminals to house in the first place. Instead of building more
  prisons, we could pocket the money and still be safer.

  Removing the 9487 drug inmates would leave 26,472.  Of those, 7200
  were in for assault, burglary, larceny-theft, or robbery.  If the
  proportion of such crimes that is related to drugs is 40 percent,
  without drug laws another 2900 persons would never have made it to
  federal prison.  The inmates who remained would be left in a less
  cruel, degrading environment. If we repealed the drug laws, we could
  eventually bring the prison population down comfortably below the
  prison's rated capacity.

  3.  Drug legalization would free up police resources to fight crimes
  against people and property.

  The considerable police efforts now expended against drug activity
  and drug-related crime could be redirected toward protecting innocent
  people from those who would still commit crime in the absence of drug
  laws.  The police could protect us more effectively, as it could focus
  resources on catching rapists, murderers and the remaining perpetrators
  of crimes against people and property.

  4.  It would unclog the court system.

  If you are accused of a crime, it takes months to bring you to
  trial. Guilty or innocent, you must live with the anxiety of impending
  trial until the trial finally begins.  The process is even more
  sluggish for civil proceedings.

  There simply aren't enough judges to handle the skyrocketing
  caseload. Because it would cut crime and eliminate drugs as a type of
  crime, legislation would wipe tens of thousands of cases off the court
  dockets across the continent, permitting the rest to move sooner and
  faster. Prosecutors would have more time to handle each case; judges
  could make more considered opinions.

  Improved efficiency at the lower levels would have a ripple effect
  on higher courts.  Better decisions in the lower courts would yield
  fewer grounds for appeals, reduing the caseloads of appeals courts; and
  in any event there would be fewer cases to review in the first place.


  5.   It would reduce official corruption.

  Drug-related police corruption takes one of two major forms.
  Police officers can offer drug dealers protection in their districts
  for a share of the profits (or demand a share under threat of
  exposure). Or they can seize dealer's merchandise for sale themselves.

  Seven current or former Philadelphia police officers were indicted
  May 31 on charges of falsifying records of money and drugs confiscated
  from dealers. During a house search, one man turned over $20,000 he had
  made from marijuana sales, but the officers gave him a "receipt" for
  $1870. Another dealer, reports The Inquirer, "told the grand jury he
  was charged with possession of five pounds of marijuana, although 11
  pounds were found in his house."

  In Miami, 59 officers have been fired or suspended since 1985 for
  suspicion of wrongdoing.  The police chief and investigators expect
  the number eventually to approach 100.  As The Palm Beach Post
  reported, "That would mean about one in 100 officers on the thousand
  man force will have been tainted by one form of scandal or another."

  Most of the 59 have been accused of trafficking, possessing or
  using illegal drugs.  In the biggest single case, 17 officers allegedly
  participated in a ring that stole $15 million worth of cocaine from
  dealers "and even traffic violators."

  What distinguishes the Miami scandal is that "Police are alleged to
  be drug traffickers themselves, not just protectors of criminals who
  are engaged in illegal activities," said The post.  According to James
  Frye, a criminologist at American University in Washington, the gravity
  of the situation in Miami today is comparable to Prohibition-era
  Chicago in the 1920s and '30s.

  It is apt comparison.  And the problem is not limited to Miami and
  Philadelphia.  The astronomical profits from the illegal drug trade
  are a powerful incentive on the part of law enforcement agents to
  partake from the proceeds.

  Legalizing the drug trade outright would eliminate this inducement
  to corruption and help to clean up the police's image.  Eliminating
  drug-related corruption cases would further reduce the strain on the
  courts, freeing judges and investigators to handle other cases more
  thoroughly and expeditiously.


  6.  Legalization would save tax money.

  Efforts to interdict the drug traffic alone cost $6.2 billion in
  1986, according to Wharton Econometrics of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.  If we ad
  the cost of trying and incarcerating users, traffickers, and those who
  commit crime to pay for their drugs, the tab runs well above $10
  billion.
  The crisis in inmate housing would disappear, saving taxpayers the
  expense of building more prisons in the future.

  As we've noted above, savings would be redirected toward better
  police protection and speedier judicial service.  Or it could be
  converted into savings for taxpayers.  Or the federal portion of the
  costs could be applied toward the budget deficit.  For a change, it's a
  happy problem to ponder.  But it takes legalization to make it
  possible.

  7.  It would cripple organized crime.

  The Mafia (heroin), Jamaican gangs (crack), and the Medellin Cartel
  (cocaine) stand to lose billions in drug profits from legalization.
  On a per-capita basis, members of organized crime, particularly at the
  top, stand to lose the most from legalizing the drug trade.

  The underworld became big business in the United States when
  alcohol was prohibited.  Few others would risk setting up the
  distribution networks, bribing officials or having to shoot up a
  policeman or competitor once in a while.  When alcohol was
  re-legalized, reputable manufacturers took over. The risk and the high
  profits went out of the alcohol trade.  Even if they wanted to keep
  control over it, the gangsters could not have targeted every
  manufacturer and every beer store.
  The profits from illegal alcohol were minuscule compared to the
  yield from today's illegal drugs.  They are the underworld's last
  great, greatest, source of illegal income--dwarfing anything to be made
  fromgambling, prostitution or other vice.

  Legalizing drugs would knock out this huge prop from under organized
  crime.  Smugglers and pushers would have to go aboveboard or go out of
  business.  There simply wouldn't be enough other criminal endeavors to
  employ them all.

  If we are concerned about the influence of organized crime on
  government, industry and our own personal safety, we could strike no
  single more damaging blow against today's gangsters than to legalize
  drugs.

  8.  Legal drugs would be safer.  Legalization is a consumer protection
  issue.

  Because it is illegal, the drug trade today lacks many of the
  consumer safety features common to other markets:  instruction sheets,
  warning labels, product quality control, manufacturer accountability.
  Driving it underground makes any product, including drugs, more
  dangerous than it needs to be.

  Nobody denies that currently illegal drugs can be dangerous.  But so
  can aspirin, countless other over-the-counter drugs and common
  household items; yet the proven hazards of matches, modeling glue and
  lawn mowers are not used as reasons to make them all illegal.

  Practically anything can kill if used in certain ways.  Like heroin,
  salt can make you sick or dead if you take enough of it.  The point is
  to learn what the threshold is, and to keep below it.  That many things
  can kill is not a reason to prohibit them all--it is a reason to find
  out how to handle products to provide the desired action safely.  The
  same goes for drugs.

  Today's drug consumer literally doesn't know what he's buying.  The
  stuff is so valuable that sellers have an incentive to "cut" (dilute)
  the product with foreign substances that look like the real thing.
  Most street heroin is only 3 to 6 percent pure;  street cocaine, 10 to
  15 percent.
  Since purity varies greatly, consumers can never be really sure how
  much to take to produce the desired effects.  If you're used to 3
  percent heroin and take a 5 percent dose, suddenly you've nearly
  doubled your intake.
  Manufacturers offering drugs on the open market would face different
  incentives than pushers.  They rely on name-brand recognition to build
  market share, and on customer loyalty to maintain it.  There would be
  a powerful incentive to provide a product of uniform quality:  killing
  customers or losing them to competitors is not a proven way to
  success. Today, dealers can make so much off a single sale that the
  incentive to cultivate a clientele is weak. In fact, police persecution
  makes it imperative to move on, damn the customers.

  Pushers don't provide labels or instructions, let alone mailing
  addresses.  The illegal nature of the business makes such things
  unnecessary or dangerous to the enterprise.  After legalization,
  pharmaceutical companies could safely try to win each other's
  customers--or guard against liability suits--with better information
  and more reliable products.

  Even pure heroin on the open market would be safer than today's
  impure drugs.  As long as customers know what they're getting and what
  it does, they can adjust their dosages to obtain the intended effect
  safely.
  Information is the best protection against the potential hazards of
  drugs or any other product.  Legalizing drugs would promote consumer
  health and safety.


  9.  Legalization would help stem the spread of AIDS and other
  diseases.
  As D.R. Blackmon notes ("Moral Deaths," June 1988), drug
  prohibition has helped propagate AIDS among intravenous drug users.

  Because IV drug users utilize hypodermic needles to inject heroin
  and other narcotics, access to needles is restricted.  The dearth of
  needles leads users to share them.  If one IV user has infected blood
  and some enters the needle as it is pulled out, the next user may shoot
  the infectious agent directly into his own bloodstream.

  Before the AIDS epidemic, this process was already known to spread
  other diseases, principally hepatitis B.  Legalizing drugs would
  eliminate the motivation to restrict the sale of hypodermic needles.
  With needles cheap and freely available, the drug users would have
  little need to share them and risk acquiring someone else's virus.

  Despite the pain and mess involved, injection became popular
  because, as The Washington Times put it, "that's the way to get the
  biggest, longest high for the money."  Inexpensive, legal heroin, on
  the other hand, would enable customers to get the same effect (using a
  greater amount) from more hygienic methods such as smoking or
  swallowing--cutting further into the use of needles and further slowing
  the spread of AIDS.

  10. Legalization would halt the erosion of other personal liberties.

  Hundreds of governments and corporations have used the alleged
  costs of drugs to begin testing their employees for drugs.
  Pennsylvania Rep. Robert Walker has embarked on a crusade to withhold
  the federal money carrot from any company or agency that doesn't
  guarantee a "drug-free workplace."

  The federal government has pressured foreign countries to grant
  access to bank records so it can check for "laundered" drug money.
  Because drug dealers handle lots of cash, domestic banks are now
  required to report cash deposits over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue
  Service for evidence of illicit profit.

  The concerns (excesses?) that led to all of these would disappear
  ipso facto with drg legalization.  Before drugs became big business,
  investors could put their money in secure banks abroad without fear of
  harassment. Mom-and-pop stores could deposit their cash receipts
  unafraid that they might look like criminals.

  Nobody makes a test for urine levels of sugar or caffeine a
  requirement for employment or grounds for dismissal.  However, were
  they declared illegal these would certainly become a lot riskier to
  use, and hence a possible target for testing "for the sake of our
  employees."  Legalizing today's illegal drugs would make them safer,
  deflating the drive to test for drug use.


  11.  It would stabilize foreign countries and make them safer to live
  in and travel to.

  The connection between drug traffickers and and guerrilla groups is
  fairly well documented (see "One More Reason," August 1987).  South
  American revolutionaries have developed a symbiotic  relationship with
  with coca growers and smugglers:  the guerrillas protect the growers
  and smugglers in echange for cash to finance their subversive
  activities.  in Peru, competing guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and
  the Tupac Amaru, fight for the lucrative right to represent coca
  farmers before drug traffickers.

  Traffickers themselves are well prepared to defend their crops
  against intruding government forces.  A Peruvian military helicopter
  was destroyed with bazooka fire in March, 1987, and 23 police officers
  were killed.  The following June, drug dealers attacked a camp of
  national guardsmen in Venezuela, killing 13.

  In Colombia, scores of police officers, more than 20 judges, two
  newspaper editors, the attorney general and the justice minister have
  been killed in that country's war against cocaine traffickers.  Two
  supreme court justices, including the court president, have resigned
  following death threats.  The Palace of Justice was sacked in 1985 as
  guerrillas destroyed the records of dozens of drug dealers.

  "This looks like Beirut," said the mayor of Medellin, Colombia,
  after a bomb ripped apart a city block where the reputed head of the
  Medellin Cartel lives.  It "is a waning of where the madness of the
  violence that afflicts us can bring us."

  Legalizing the international drug trade would affect organized
  crime and subversion abroad much as it would in the United States.  A
  major source for guerrilla funding would disappear.  So would the
  motive for kidnapping or assassinating officials and private
  individuals.  As in the United States, ordinary Colombians and
  Peruvians once again could walk the streets and travel the roads
  without fear of drug-related violence.  Countries would no longer be
  paralyzed by smugglers.

  12.  Legalization would repair U.S. relations with other countries and
  curtail anti-American sentiment around the world.

  a. When Honduran authorities spirited away alleged drug lord Juan
  Matta Ballesteros and had him extradited to the United States in April,
  Hondurans rioted in the streets and demonstrated for days at the U.S.
  embassy in Tegucigulpa.

  The action violated Honduras's constitution, which prohibits
  extradition.  Regardless of what Matta may have done, many Hondurans
  viewed the episode as a flagrant violation of their little country's
  laws, just to satisfy the wishes of the colossus up North.

  b.  When the U.S. government, in July 1986, sent Army troops and
  helicopters to raid cocaine factories in Bolivia, Bolivians were
  outraged. The constitution "has been trampled," said the president of
  Bolivia's House of Representatives.  The country's constitution
  requires congressional approval for any foreign military presence.

  c.  One thousand coca growers marched through the capital, La Paz,
  chanting "Death to the United States" and "Up with Coca" last May in
  protest over a U.S.-sponsored bill to prohibit most coca production.
  In late June, 5000 angry farmers overran a U.S. Drug Enforcement
  Administration jungle base, demanding the 40 American soldiers and
  drug agents there leave immediately.

  U.S. pressure on foreign governments to fight their domestic drug
  industries has clearly reinforced the image of America as an
  imperialist bully, blithely indifferent to the concerns of other
  peoples.  To Bolivian coca farmers, the U.S. government is not a beacon
  of freedom, but a threat to their livelihoods.  To many Hondurans it
  seems that their government will ignore its own constitution on request
  from Uncle Sam.  Leftists exploit such episodes to fan nationalistic
  sentiment to promote their agendas.

  Legalizing the drug trade would remove some of the reasons to hate
  America and deprive local politicians of the chance to exploit them.
  The U.S. would have a new opportunity to repair its reputation in an
  atmosphere of mutual respect.
